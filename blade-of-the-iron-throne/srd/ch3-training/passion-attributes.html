			<p class="h2">Passion Attributes</p>
			<p>Passion Attributes mirror things that are important to the Character, but they comprise first and foremost 
			that which is important to the Player. Within the constraints of his Character’s fictional personality, the 
			Player sets whatever he wants as Passion Attributes.</p>
			
			<p>The constraint of the Character’s personality will mean that a Passion Attribute has to concur with 
			something the Character wants, likes, or dislikes.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="container text-justify">
		<div class="panel-body">
			<p class="h4">Passion Attributes</p>
			<p>Passions need not be identical to the Character’s personality description. The Passion Attributes are a way 
			for the Player to signal to his GM what he would like to have adventures about. Together with making the 
			Character more – almost cinematically – efficient in these adventures, these are the most important functions 
			of the Passion Attribute.</p>
			
			<p>A Player may, for instance, create a Character with a fierce hatred of slavery as one of her central 
			personality traits. However, if the Player isn't interested in leading her Character through adventures where 
			she would regularly contend with slavery and slavers, the Player need not (and shouldn't) turn this hatred of 
			slavery into a Passion Attribute as this attribute would simply sit in the background, adding colour to the 
			Character’s personality and certainly impacting the way she is role-played, but not be a central issue in her 
			adventures.</p>
			
			<p>Only items that a Player wants to figure heavily in her Character’s adventures should ever be made into 
			Passion Attributes. Should a Player ever wish to change the focus of her Character’s adventures, she may just 
			change one or more of her Passion Attributes.</p>
			
			<p>Doing so is permissible even in the middle of a session. The sole constraint of the new Passion Attribute 
			is a degree of plausibility. If it's sufficiently plausible within the framework of the Character’s 
			established personality that a new Passion Attribute is warranted, the change is allowed. This process is not 
			adjudicated by the Game Master, but by the entire group <em>communally</em>; the GM has no more say than anyone 
			else at the table. If the group approves of the change, the Player needs only to drop the Passion Attribute to 
			be changed down to a score of 0, and spend 1 point from any other Passion Attribute to affect the change. In 
			the case when a Passion Attribute has run its course and attained its subject, the Player may reduce it to 0 
			and then change it to another Passion Attribute at no cost. This is only possible if the new Passion can be 
			regarded as one that develops naturally from the old, attained one.</p>
			
			<p>For example, if a Character attains the Passion <em>Become High-Priest of Set</em>, the Passion <em>Have the 
			Worship of Set Elevated to State Religion</em> would be a logical and free new Passion, but <em>Win the Love of 
			the Queen of Aquilonia</em> wouldn’t (unless it was previously made clear that becoming high-priest was only a 
			stepping stone for getting close to the Queen).</p>
			
			<p>Whether a new Passion is a logical extension of the old one is again adjudicated by the group as a whole, 
			not by the GM. The score of a Passion Attribute advances by engaging it in play. Every time the Character 
			takes a considerable risk (ex. enters combat) or accepts a considerable disadvantage (ex. alienating powerful 
			people) to either further or defend one of his Passion Attributes, he is immediately awarded a single point in 
			the pertinent Attribute. Also, if the Passion represents a goal (ex. freeing someone, or attaining something), 
			every time the Character takes a significant step towards the realization of this goal, he is awarded a single 
			point. How many points are gained each session in this way depends on a group’s tastes, but it shouldn’t be 
			less than 3 or more than 6.</p>
			
			<p>The flip side is that the score of Passion Attributes can – rarely – also decrease. Every time a Character 
			acts grossly <strong>against</strong> one his Passion Attributes (ex. trafficking in slaves if he has a Passion 
			Attribute of <em>Abolish and Destroy Slavery in the Realm</em>), or alternatively fails to follow up on an 
			obvious opportunity to draw nearer to a goal, he immediately loses a point from the Passion Attribute in 
			question.</p>
			
			<p>Passion Attributes may not be kept secret from one’s fellow Players, even if they represent some secret 
			goal of the Character. Any Player is entitled at any time to know the Passion Attributes of all his fellow 
			Players. In fact, this kind of knowledge is strongly advised and encouraged, as Passions can (and should) be 
			used to tie the individual Characters together as a group.</p>
			
			<p>Protagonists of Sword & Sorcery fiction are often loners and outcasts, headstrong and callous individuals 
			governed mainly by self-interest. Such people don't naturally fall into the traditional kind of adventuring 
			group. Instead, some plausible reason for such Characters cooperation needs to be found, and the most 
			plausible is, of course, mutual benefit. Passion Attributes - often representing a character’s goals and 
			drives - are an excellent tool to this end. By ensuring that all Characters have one or more Passion Attribute 
			compatible with, or similar to, each other, the group will gain coherence.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_GroupPassions">			
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Some of the goals of the various Characters of such a group will 
				complement each other, and the Characters will have good reason to cooperate. Character A might, for 
				example, have the Passion</em> Hate for Sultan Zafra of Samara<em>, Character B the Passion</em> Become 
				Sultan of Samara<em>, and Character C the Passion</em> Destroy the Cult of Baraz<em> (the main protector 
				and adherent of which happens to be Sultan Zafra). Without the three Passions being identical, any 
				adventure in which Sultan Zafra is the opponent or in which Sultan Zafra stands to suffer will engage the 
				Passion Attributes of all three characters, giving them a reason to stay together.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>The recommended method of establishing a link between Characters by means of Passion Attributes is communal 
			Character creation, where all Players are present when everybody else’s Character is being created, and where 
			everybody may make suggestions and throws out ideas.</p>
			
			<p>While this is the best method of establishing a strong link that does not appear contrived, communal 
			Character creation isn't always possible. If it isn’t, it can be substituted by leaving one of the four Passion 
			Attribute slots of every participating Character undefined. This free slot should be filled during the first 
			session with a Passion that makes the Characters collaborators of convenience, tying them together into a 
			semblance of a group.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_SpendingPassion">Spending Passion Points</p>
			<p>Chapter One outlined a number of ways to use Passion Attributes. Using Passion Attribute points does not 
			deplete them in any way; they can be applied as bonus dice again and again. Spending Passion Attribute points 
			is different.</p>
			
			<p>All other traits increase by permanently spending Passion Attribute Points. These points, once spent, are 
			lost - and may only be regained through play (as described above). When spending these points, they may come 
			in any quantity from any combination of Passion Attributes.</p>
