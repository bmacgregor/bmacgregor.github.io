			<p class="h2">Drama</p>
			<p>Drama is the great wild card of all the Passion Attributes. Every Character has it, it can never be exchanged 
			for another Passion Attribute, and it does not represent a facet of his personality. Instead, it's a mechanical 
			representation, an extra bit of heroic capability, and sometimes even luck. It represents the Player’s means to 
			influence game events directly, above and beyond his Character’s actions, and it can be used in several 
			ways.</p>

		<div class="panel-body">
			<p class="h4" id="P_LuckyBreak">Lucky Break</p>
			<p>A point of Drama can be spent to affect a specific change in the game world, usually one that is beneficial 
			to the Character that spends the point.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_GroupPassions">			
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: One of the jailers of the dungeon into which the Character is thrown turns 
				out to be a buddy from her mercenary days. The kennel master has this evening forgotten to turn loose the 
				guardian lions roaming the compound the Players are breaking into at night. The daughter of the chieftain 
				of the barbarian tribe whose aid the Characters need takes a romantic interest in the Character.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>The lucky break can be quite substantial. It should not, however, solve some problem for the Character 
			outright. Instead, it should provide an excellent opening for the Character to solve the problem himself. The 
			specifics of the Lucky Break are up to the Player expending the Drama, but the Game Master need not accept any 
			wish of the Player’s. The GM is encouraged to go with the flow and allow the Lucky Break the Player desires, 
			even if it should be immensely advantageous, but he is not required to do so. He can refuse it, especially if 
			he finds that a certain lucky break would defuse the entire adventure.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_SceneRequest">Scene Request</p>
			<p>A point of Drama can be spent to move a scene forward. The Game Master can then bring the current scene to a 
			close as soon as possible, and moves on to the next.</p>
			
			<p>Another flexible use for the Drama Attribute is for Scene Requests. The Player spends a point of drama, and 
			describes the scene they would like to the GM. The Player may make a request to the Game Master for a future 
			scene - one featuring content that’s of particular interest to the Player. Perhaps a Player would like her 
			Character to begin a romance with the son of the Jarl, or force a showdown with a hated rival. The 
			possibilities are endless. Such requests <em>do not</em> compel the GM to dive headlong into the requested 
			scene, but does oblige the Game Master to begin the creative process so that the requested scene comes up as 
			soon as possible for the Character. As long as she is honestly working to fulfill the spirit of the Player’s 
			request, the details of how the scene is framed and exactly when it occurs is left to the GM's discretion.</p></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_HaveSuccess">Have a Success</p>
			<p>A point of Drama can be spent in a non-combat situation to achieve a considerable success on a Check 
			without the need to roll the dice. The result is treated as if a number of dice out of his pool had turned up 
			as successes, shown on the following table. However, the choice to forego a Check and spend Drama must be made 
			<em>before</em> any dice are rolled. Once a Check has been made, its results stand.</p>
			
			<p class="h4">Have a Success</p>
			<table class="table table-striped table-hover" id="TBL_HaveASuccess">
				<thead>
					<th>Number of Dice to be Rolled</th>
					<th>Successes Gained</th>

			<p class="h4" id="P_StealLimelight">Stealing the Limelight</p>
			<p>A point of Drama can be spent to change a combat’s Order of Limelights. Doing so requires the payment of 1 
			Drama point, and the sole caution that the player who Steals the Limelight must not yet have had his Limelight 
			moment during the current Round of Limelights.</p>
			
			<p>By Stealing the Limelight, the sequence of Limelights is changed – and remains changed. The player who has 
			spent the Drama point has thereby elevated himself from his old place in the sequence to the new one, and the 
			order of Limelights created by this act of Stealing the Limelight becomes the new order of Limelights for the 
			remainder of the combat – or until someone else Steals the Limelight yet again. Stealing the Limelight can be 
			advantageous in many situations, and is often done to enable one PC to rush to another character’s aid.</p>
			
			<p>This is further described in Chapter Four, Combat.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_MeleeSurvival">Optional Drama Use : Melee Survival</p>
			<p>If the group so desires, it can allow a point of Drama to be spent to reduce the effects of a wound that 
			would either kill a Character, or incapacitate her to die soon. Such Drama expenditure invariably knocks the 
			Character unconcious, but also ensures her survival. The Game Master may not rule that the incapacitated 
			Character is dispatched by her victorious enemies. She is, however, encouraged to come up with some other nasty 
			consequence for the Character. What this is depends entirely on the situation.</p>
			
			<p>She may be captured by her enemies, or her body may be looted of some important possession. She might receive 
			a nasty (and lasting) scar. The Game Master should be creative, but should avoid imposing something on the 
			Character that ruins the Player’s continued fun.</p>
			
			<p>The injury suffered is only assigned a definite Wound Level once the Character regains consciousness. This 
			should usually be a Level 4 wound, but it can be Level 3.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_UseByNPC">Drama Use by NPC's</p>
			<p>NPC's, even the most important ones, never have Passion Attributes. This includes Drama. There is, however, 
			a way by which a Game Master can enjoy the equivalent of spending a point of Drama for one of his NPC's.</p>
			
			<p><strong>When he wants an NPC to have a Lucky Break, Have a Success, or Melee Survival (if this optional rule 
			is being used), he may announce this and offer a single point of Drama to the player of any PC involved in the 
			current scene.</p>
			
			<p>If the player accepts, he gains a Drama point, and the NPC gets the benefit. If he refuses, the Game Master 
			may ask <em>any other player</em> whose Character is involved in the scene, until a player either accepts the 
			deal or all have declined it.</strong></p>
			
			<p>The order in which the GM asks the Players is entirely up to him. A savvy Game Master will, of course, use 
			this discretion to best effect to get his desired Drama use. After all, the instinct of the Player asked first 
			might be to decline, but he can’t be sure that one asked later will not accept anyway, in which case he will 
			have foregone a point of Drama for nothing.</p>
			
			<p>In any case, the referee can resort to this mechanic no more than once per scene in total (not once per 
			scene, per NPC). Drama is not raised like the other Passion Attributes, but may be gained as outlined above, or 
			through any of the following three ways:</p>
			
			<p><strong>First</strong>, any time you make the whole group laugh or impress them with an outstandingly fine 
			plan, idea, or dramatic piece of role-play you immediately gain one point. This specifically includes hearty 
			and full-mouthed quips made by the Characters in the face of danger, or after overcoming it.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Second</strong>, if a Player achieves a spectacular and unexpected success on any Check in the 
			course of one session, she gains one point at the close of that session. If several Players qualify, the point 
			goes to the one with the most impressive success, as decided by the group.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Third</strong>, any Player who has rolled a spectacularly poor Check during the session gets a 
			“consolation point” at this session’s end. If several Players qualify, the point is, again, awarded to the 
			Player decided on by the group. No more than three Drama points may be gained by any Player in a single 
			session.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, one can also transfer points to (but not from) the Drama Attribute. At the very beginning and the 
			very end of a session, all Players have the opportunity to exchange any number of points from any of their 
			Passion Attributes to points in the Drama Attribute (to a maximum of 5), at a rate of a point for a point.</p>
