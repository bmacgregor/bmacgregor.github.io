			<p class="h2">Character Progression</p>
			<p>As your Character experiences new things, furthers his own goals, beliefs, and personal philosophies, he 
			will also improve in many ways. There is no concept of Character “levels”, as each trait grows independently, 
			allowing the entire Character to grow and change according to his Player’s wishes. All advancement comes from 
			one source: constant effort in playing out and furthering one’s Passion Attributes.</p>

		<div class="panel-body">
			<p class="h4">Raising Basic Attributes</p>
			<p>Any Attribute may be raised by spending Passion Attribute equal to three times its current score. Raising a 
			character’s “Focus” Attribute costs 1 point less. No Attribute may be increased by more than one point per 
			session.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Proficiencies">Buying and Raising Proficiencies</p>
			<p>Proficiencies are easier to raise than Attributes, but require that a Character either spend some time 
			training or using the Proficiency during the course of play. Not much training is needed, assuming the 
			Character has an hour or so a day to spend practicing. </p>
			
			<p>To raise a Proficiency by one level, spend a number of Passion Attribute points equal to twice the current 
			Proficiency level. The cost to raise the Greatsword Proficiency from four to five would be eight Passion 
			Points. As with Attributes, only one level increase per Proficiency is allowed during any one game session.</p>
			
			<p>Acquiring a new Proficiency requires either that the Proficiency has been used during the course of play 
			or that a teacher with Proficiency level three or better was consulted. These cost a single Passion point. 
			Entirely new Proficiencies are bought up from the Character’s best default rating in that Proficiency. Buying 
			Cut & Thrust would cost one point to begin at level one, but if the Character is already proficient in 
			Greatsword (which defaults to Cut & Thrust at -3) you could buy the new Proficiency as if you were already at 
			the same level as Greatsword -3.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Assets">Buying and Raising Assets</p>
			<p>Some Assets may be bought (or bought off) during the game, provided that these developments seem plausible to 
			the group. Acquiring an entirely new Good Asset or buying off a Poor Asset <em>acquired from the Culture 
			Priority Pick</em> costs twenty Passion. Otherwise, buying off a Poor Asset or acquiring the Good aspect of an 
			Asset which the Character already has the Poor aspect costs fifteen Passion.</p>
			
			<p>With some Assets, for example Berserk and Spell-Gifted, it does not make sense to have both their Good and 
			Poor aspects simultaneously. If a Character has the Poor aspect of one and buys it off, she can never acquire 
			its Good aspect. If she has designs of changing such an Asset’s Poor aspect into the Good one, she first must 
			purchase the Good aspect and <em>then</em> buy off the Poor aspect. For as long as she has not bought off the 
			Poor aspect, it applies in full and she will not receive the benefits from the purchased Good aspect.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Skills">Buying and Raising Skills</p>
			<p>Skills are easy to develop. To raise a Skill by one level, spend a number of Passion Attribute points equal 
			to the current Skill level. Entirely new Skills may be purchased for one Passion Attribute point, and begin at 
			level one. Keep in mind that when purchasing a new Skill at a level lower than the rating the Character has in 
			that Skill’s applicable Attribute (as listed in the Skill’s description), it will cost one point less than the 
			Attribute’s rating, though always at least one point.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, improving one’s Skill rating in either the Ancient Languages or Foreign Language Skill costs one 
			less Passion point than would otherwise be charged, though again a minimum of one point must be spent. 
			Furthermore, the initial Passion point expended towards the acquisition of an entirely new Foreign Language 
			(though not Ancient Language) Skill immediately buys an initial rating level of two, not one.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Loot">Loot</p>
			<p>The Loot rating measures a Character’s wealth. Every point in it represents an abstract amount of 
			affluence. In concrete terms, every point of Loot represents roughly ten times the wealth of the level below 
			it. This encompasses a Character’s total wealth in money, as well as both movable and immovable goods.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>0 : Dead broke. Just the shabby or torn (and thus worthless) clothes on your back</li>
				<li>1 : Poor. A set of clothes, some coin, or a few items</li>
				<li>2 : Average. The normal amount of wealth for a commoner</li>
				<li>3 : Rich. Fashionable clothes and spending money</li>
				<li>4 : Filthy Rich. Accompanied by servants, lower nobility</li>
				<li>5 : Fantastically Rich. Titled nobility such as Kings, Lords, Queens, and Ladies</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>If a Character wants to buy something, the Game Master judges whether his Loot score suggests that he should 
			be able to afford it or not. If the purchase seems within the Character’s means, he can buy it. If it’s judged 
			to be well beyond it, he can’t.</p>
			
			<p>If the issue seems questionable, the Character’s Cunning pool is rolled against either a Challenging (two 
			successes) or Difficult (three successes) task. If the Check is successful, the Character can make the 
			purchase, but he can’t afford to make another purchase that would require a roll for the remainder of the 
			session.</p>
			
			<p>A newly created Character’s Loot is set at any level the Player wants, provided it corresponds to the 
			Character’s backstory and the circumstances under which she commences play. The entire group is the communal 
			arbitrator of whether an assigned Loot score is reasonable or not.</p>
			
			<p>When a Character acquires money or valuables of a magnitude that suggests an increase to her current Loot, 
			her rating is increased automatically, provided the wealth gained is judged to be clearly many times greater 
			than the Character’s current means. If it is merely deemed to be considerably greater, the Character should 
			make a Cunning Check with her possible new Loot rating as the Challenge Level. If she passes the test, her Loot 
			rating increases.</p>
			
			<p>Sword & Sorcery protagonists are notoriously bad at hanging on to money, either because they spend 
			fistfuls of it on drink, wenching, gambling, and other forms of hard carousing, or because they simply don’t 
			seem to care much about keeping their accounts balanced. Because of this, a Character’s Loot rating is 
			decreased by one between game sessions, provided that a considerable amount of time has passed since the last 
			session.</p>
			
			<p>Players can avoid having their Loot levels deteriorate if they pass a Check of their Character’s Cunning 
			with a Challenge Level of (5 – current Loot level). Passion Attributes don’t apply to this roll, but Drama can 
			be spent in the usual manner. What constitutes a sufficient span of time for Loot to decrease due to spending 
			depends on the circumstances in which this time is passed. In a city, a week is sufficient, but in a remote 
			monastery or some such, several months could pass before a roll might become necessary.</p>
