			<p>It's possible for multiple Proficiencies to cover the use of any weapon. For example, a character with a

			which one would wield a sword. In other words, <em>how</em> the weapon is wielded is more important than what

			version is popular throughout the western half. Brawling involves, first and foremost, punching and kicking - 
			delivered by means of the Bash Maneuver – and also grappling and plenty of dirty tricks. While mostly an 
			unarmed Proficiency, the use of knuckledusters, saps and the like is also incorporated.</p>

			<p>The true two-handed sword is an enormous weapon. It resembles a spear more than a sword in actual use, and 
			is wielded frequently with a wide, half-swording grip. Greatswords are generally at least 1.5 meters long - 
			about a quarter of that being hilt – and they often sport a second pair of cross guards. They are fearsome 
			weapons with great range, but the greatswordsman is easily overcome by any fighter agile enough to get into 
			close range.</p>

			<p>As fighting from horseback became more and more practical and efficient, heavy cavalry came into being. 
			Cavalry’s weapon of choice in an opening charge is the lance, a long spear, frequently of specialized design. 
			This weapon is found anywhere there are knights or heavy cavalry. Lances range from 2.5 to just over 4 meters 
			in length.</p>
			
			<p>They are usually butted under the right arm and used with a shield. Lances, though made of wood, are 
			usually capped with a long steel or iron point. A sporting version, the jousting lance, has a blunted tip for 
			tournaments. The primary advantages to a lance are its range and power in a charge, where it uses the mount’s 
			full Brawn, not half the riders Brawn, to calculate Impact Rating.</p>

			<p>For those warriors who prefer to fight without shields, large swords are very popular. They are fierce 
			weapons, capable of heavy damage when cleaving or thrusting, and they are excellent for complex maneuvering 
			and countering.</p>
			
			<p>The Longsword Proficiency incorporates all swords that are primarily intended for two-handed wielding. 
			However, longwords are still short enough to be wielded in just one hand with little or no discomfort. The 
			primary advantages of these weapons include extended range, great cleaving power, and a wide variety of 
			Maneuvers.</p>

			<p>Since the earliest clubs, mass weapons have found their place in warfare. Alongside the development of 
			better armor, clubs and farming tools were transformed into battle-axes, picks, flails, morning stars, and 
			maces. These weapons are in use the world over and are particularly popular both with the peasant 
			infantryman (these weapons are cheap) and the armored gentry (these weapons are especially effective 
			against tougher armors). Mass weapons include any single-handed (and occasionally two-handed) weapon that is 
			particularly heavy on the business end.</p>
			
			<p>These weapons’ balance makes them slow on the parry and commends the use of constant evasion or - more 
			commonly - shields. Most axes and hammers are fitted with a secondary spike or hammer on the back and/or top. 
			To flip the weapon over, Characters spend one point from their Melee Pool <strong>if done during a Combat 
			Round</strong>. As with polearms, exact Maneuvers are dependent on the weapon at hand; discretion and common 
			sense need to be used. This Proficiency may be used without a shield at no penalty, but any shield based 
			Maneuvers are, in this case, impossible.</p>

			<p>Wrestling, though popular as a sport, is really the most desperate of all battle techniques. As with
