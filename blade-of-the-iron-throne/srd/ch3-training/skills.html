			<p class="h2">Skills Overview</p>
			<p>Skills are specialized bits of knowledge that a character can learn and eventually master. They are more 
			specific applications of an Attribute. For example, Trapping is a more specific use of a Character’s Cunning. 
			Skills are areas of expertise that are not necessarily common to every living creature - some creatures simply 
			don’t have the capacity to learn certain Skills. Initially purchased with Skill points and chosen according to 
			the Player’s particular interest, Characters learn their Skills through instruction or experience.</p>

		<div class="panel-body">
			<p class="h4">Skill Descriptions</p>
			<p>As this Skill list includes broad definitions not applicable to all settings for which <em>Blade</em> could 
			be used, the Game Master has the final say on actual Skill applications. Skills are described with the 
			Attribute with which they are most commonly associated.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3">A</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Acting">Acting (Heart)</p>
			<p>The Character is skilled in all aspects of stage acting in front of crowds. Memorizing lines, voice 
			projection, body control, and mimicry are all within the range of the normal use of this Skill. A Character may 
			be required to make Checks when putting on an important show, in front of a large crowd, or if required to 
			speak difficult lines. The Character can accurately mimic the voice of any given individual that he has heard 
			speak at least once.</p>
			
			<p>Without the Disguise Skill, this can be useful when shouting or speaking to another person from behind a 
			door or out of sight. When combined with Disguise, Acting can be used to play the part of a specific person. 
			In this case, only the worse of the two Skills is checked during the interaction, not both.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_AncLanguages">Ancient Languages (Sagacity)</p>
			<p>This Skill provides the ability to read, write, and eventually speak one chosen language from a long ago, 
			lost civilization. Ancient Languages can only be used to learn languages from the past that are not typically 
			spoken in the Character’s modern world. The Character’s ability with this Skill is directly related to its 
			level.</p>
			
			<p>At levels 1-3, the Character can recognize common written glyphs and symbols in the language. As the Skill's 
			level increases, she gains an understanding of progressively more obscure elements of the language.</p>
			
			<p>At levels 4-6, she can begin to surmise how the ancient language was spoken, based on her knowledge of the 
			language and later languages developed from it.</p>
			
			<p>By levels 7-9, she can speak the language with fluency and flair. Literacy is a prerequisite for this Skill. 
			At Character creation, every Skill point invested into Ancient Languages buys two points in a specific Ancient 
			Language.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_AniKen">Animal Ken (Heart)</p>
			<p>A Character with Animal Ken is particularly keen on determining the drive, desires, demeanor, and feelings 
			of an animal. To use this Skill, the Character must observe a creature for a few minutes, and then roll a Skill 
			Check. If successful, the Character can sense something about the creature’s current motivation, desires, or 
			the specifics of its emotional state. Additional information may be gained through further Skill Checks.</p>
			
			<p>This Skill is useful when attempting to train animals, however, it can only be used to teach an animal 
			something it is able to perform, within the constraints of its intelligence level and body shape.</p>
			
			<p>Tricks might include searching out or tracking specific prey, retrieving objects, guarding others or an 
			area, reacting in specific ways to symbols or hand motions, returning home from any location, attacking or 
			retreating on command, walking with a particular gait, and many more.</p>
			
			<p>This Skill can also be used to affect the creature’s overall behavior - perhaps to make it more passive or 
			more aggressive than it normally would be, for example. </p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Apothecary">Apothecary (Sagacity)</p>
			<p>Throughout history, different cultures have devised remedies for a wide range of ailments. The Character 
			with an Apothecary skill is able to create non-magical, medicinal drugs from plants, minerals, and animal 
			parts. These medicines’ benefits are not instant; efficacy may take between minutes and several hours. They may 
			carry side effects, especially when they are potent.</p>
			
			<p>This skill includes the study of poisons, their effects and detection, and the treatment of poisoned 
			individuals. The Character can diagnose a poisoned Character and recommend an antidote or treatment if he can 
			identify the symptoms and the source of the poison, or if he has a sample of the poison itself.</p>
			
			<p>A successful Skill Check allows the creation of medicines, poisons, or antidotes from ingredients at hand. 
			Note that while this skill provides the knowledge of how to prepare ingredients to make medicines, poisons, 
			and antidotes, it does not provide the Character with the ability to find the ingredients in the wild, which 
			is an application of the Survival Skill.</p>
			
			<hr>
			
			<p class="h3">B</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_BattleTactics">Battlefield Tactics (Sagacity)</p>
			<p>This Skill gives a Character the savvy to move troops and resources into optimal battle-field position. She 
			knows when and where to fight to make the most of her available troops and resources, taking advantage of 
			terrain and weather. This allows an experienced tactician to fight large-scale battles with fewer soldiers than 
			an opponent with a reasonable chance of success.</p>
			
			<p>With knowledge of the battlefield and the standard tactics of her opponent, the Character will spend a few 
			minutes with her comrades, explaining the tactics to be employed in the upcoming battle. This discussion must 
			take place within two hours of battle. She then makes an opposed Battlefield Tactics Check against the enemies’ 
			commander. If successful, all comrades that received the instructions gain a –1 Target Number modifier to all 
			Soldiering Checks made during that combat.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3">C</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Climbing">Climbing (Daring)</p>
			<p>This Skill provides a Character with the ability to climb many types of vertical surfaces. The number of 
			successful Climbing Checks needed to complete a task may vary, and especially long climbs may require a 
			string of Checks. In this case each single Skill Check should represent a real and tangible benefit, like a 
			concrete leg of the trek being completed, not just some distance climbed.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Customs">Customs (Heart)</p>
			<p>This Skill provides an understanding of other cultures’ customs. A Character does not risk of offending 
			people from a known culture, and is adept at quickly recognizing and reacting to the customs of newly 
			encountered cultures. This differs from Etiquette in that Etiquette only provides knowledge of the social 
			intricacies of the elite, whereas Customs is equally effective across all portions of a population. Customs 
			cannot be used to duplicate the effects of Etiquette, so a Character with Customs - but without Etiquette - 
			could not appear as one of the aristocracy.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3">D</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Dancing">Dancing (Daring)</p>
			<p>The Character knows the artistry of dancing, and is trained in the art of performing in front of an 
			audience. The Character is well versed in all the popular dances of the time, including those with complex or 
			detailed steps. He is also adept at picking up new dances, and can create his own which may become popular.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Decipher">Decipher (Sagacity)</p>
			<p>This Skill provides the ability to decipher unknown written words, codes or glyphs. When faced with an 
			unknown text, a Character uses this Skill to appraise the frequency and patterns of certain symbols, and to 
			come up with theories of what she believes the communication to hold.</p>
			
			<p>This time consuming process could take several minutes or several months, depending upon the length of the 
			text. It should be noted that while Decipher can be used to interpret any text, including unknown languages, 
			the process for reading such a text is much longer than it would be with any of the language Skills, and it 
			does not result in any improved knowledge of the language.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_DetectSorc">Detect Sorcery (Cunning)</p>
			<p>Successful use of this Skill allows a Character to detect the presence and effects of sorcerous spells and 
			the eldritch energies that are emitted by all sorcerous objects and supernatural beings. She is also, using the 
			Scrying Lesser Mystery, able to detect a disembodied consciousness. However, this Skill is not sensitive enough 
			for awareness of spells or effects once they have worn off.</p>
			
			<p>Sorcery can be detected casually, even in passing, although detection is easier if a Character touches an 
			object and concentrates for a full Limelight. During that time, a single object or the Character’s immediate 
			vicinity (to about 3 meters) can be examined.</p>
			
			<p>To detect sorcery in a single object or being, one Success is usually sufficient, providing the Character 
			touches it and concentrates. Two Successes are required if she actively examines it without touching it.</p>
			
			<p>Detecting sorcery by chance - simply touching an object without actively looking for sorcerous energies - 
			requires three Successes. For detection of sorcery in the vicinity, two Successes will alert a Character to the 
			presence of sorcerous energies. Three Successes will locate their approximate source, and four Successes will 
			accurately pinpoint the origin as long as the Character uses the Skill actively. To notice sorcery in passing 
			requires one additional Success.</p>
			
			<p>This Skill is especially sensitive to the presence of any disembodied consciousness’ using the Scrying 
			Lesser Mystery. These presences can be noticed at a distance of up to twn meters, and one less Success is 
			required than for detection of sorcery. In other words one to three successes if one uses the Skill actively, 
			or two to four successes if using it passively. If enough Successes are achieved to pinpoint the origin of this 
			supernatural effect (ex. three or four), the Character does not just feel the disembodied presence; she 
			actually sees it.</p>
			
			<p>Especially faint or strong manifestations of sorcerous energies may require one or more additional or 
			fewer Successes than given in the guidelines above.</p>
			
			<p><em><strong>This Skill is available only to characters created with Talent Table “Sorcery” choices of 
			A-C.</strong></em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Disguise">Disguise (Cunning)</p>
			<p>This Skill endows a Character with the ability to transform himself or someone else. A basic Check allows 
			the Character to appear different from his current self with changes of hair, clothing, sex, or social class, 
			along with measurable changes such as weight and height. When combined with Acting, Disguise can be used to 
			play the part of a specific person. To do this, all Skill Checks must be successful. In this situation, only 
			the worse of the two Skills need be checked during the interaction, not both.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3">E</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Etiquette">Etiquette (Heart)</p>
			<p>The Character understands the social intricacies of encounters with the elite. She knows what to talk about 
			(and what not to), how to greet others, which utensils to use when eating and how these should be held, which 
			dance steps are in vogue, and any number of other verbal and non-verbal upper-class courtesies. With the 
			Customs skill, but without Etiquette, one might pass as a member of another culture, but not as one of their 
			aristocracy.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3">F</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Falsehood">Falsehood (Heart / Sagacity)</p>
			<p>Characters may use this Skill to tell lies (Heart), or to detect lies (Sagacity) and resist the detection 
			of their own lies (Heart). Success is automatic unless the lie is outlandish enough for listeners to become 
			suspicious. Such a case would require a Falsehood vs. Falsehood Check. Should the target not possess the 
			Falsehood Skill, he would employ Sagacity with twice the number of needed successes. Studying the various 
			forms of dishonesty, one becomes necessarily both doubtful of people’s honesty and adept at behaving in a 
			controlled way so as to give nothing away.</p>
			
			<p>When somebody proficient in Falsehood tells the truth and is suspected otherwise, as lying has become 
			second nature to him, he must use his Falsehood Skill and score <em>twice</em> the usual number of successes 
			required in order to overcome the doubts of the listener. Should the Check be tied or fails, he is automatically 
			considered to be lying.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_FrgnLanguages">Foreign Languages (Sagacity)</p>
			<p>This Skill provides a Character the ability to speak one chosen non-native language that is in current 
			use in her world. The level of the Skill determines the extent of her knowledge. Thus, a Character with a 
			level of one to three would be able to speak like a person who has arrived in a new country, and be able to 
			read everyday signs about town.</p>
			
			<p>Those with the Skill at the level of seven to nine have the vocabulary of a highly intelligent scholar or 
			writer. At Character creation, every Skill point invested into a Foreign Language Skill buys two points in that 
			language.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3">H</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Healing">Healing (Sagacity)</p>
			<p>In the event of injury, illness or disease, the Healing Skill endows a Character with an understanding of 
			medical procedures and medicines to help himself and others. (Note that the creation of medicines and 
			poisons, or the neutralizing of poisons requires the Apothecary Skill.)</p>
			
			<p>One of the most important uses of the Healing Skill is First Aid. When an injury occurs, if a successful 
			Healing Check is performed within an hour, the patient regains one Pain point per success against the wound 
			being tended.</p>
			
			<p>Healing can also be used to provide continuing care to an injured patient. When a Character rolls his weekly 
			Tenacity Check to determine if he has shed Pain points, a Character with the Healing Skill can tend to him, 
			rolling his own Healing Skill Check just prior to the injured Character’s Tenacity Check. If the Healing Check 
			is successful, the injured character gains one bonus success for his Tenacity Check for each success scored in 
			the Healer’s Check.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3">I</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_InfoGather">Information Gathering (Heart)</p>
			<p>A Character with this Skill is adept at tracking down the answers to questions and mysteries by finding 
			the right person to talk to. Usually in a public location - perhaps a bar or a shop - the Character is led step 
			by step to the information she seeks through conversation, purchasing goods, or making small bribes.</p>
			
			<p>The Character should be smart about how she asks questions, especially when she is seeking information about 
			a powerful person that has a lot of influence in the area. It may require several steps, each with a Check of 
			its own, and each with its own role-playing opportunity. </p>
			
			<p>Penalties may be applied to the Checks if the Character is speaking to someone who may be reluctant to 
			reveal information. </p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3">L</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LightStep">Light Step (Cunning)</p>
			<p>A Character can use this Skill to place less pressure upon any surface on which he steps. This allows him 
			to leave no tracks in mud or snow, or even to walk across short distances of liquid. If a trap were to be 
			triggered by a pressure plate, this Skill could be used to move across it without incident.</p>
			
			<p>In all cases, the Character must move briskly while using Light Step. <em>Attributes can never be used to 
			stand in for a Check of this Skill. If a Character isn’t explicitly trained in its use, he cannot attempt 
			it.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LockPick">Lock Picking (Cunning)</p>
			<p>A Character with this Skill is able to pick or disable locks. Generally, two tools are needed to pick a 
			lock: a flat-headed implement (called a “tension wrench”) used to turn the lock, and a pointed tool (the 
			“pick”) used to manipulate the pins inside the lock. These can be makeshift versions, but without tools of some 
			type, the Character cannot use this Skill to open a mechanical lock.</p>
			
			<p>This Skill can also be used to disable other kinds of locks, including bars and latches on the opposite 
			side of the door, as long as some crack in or around the door is accessible. </p>
			
			<p>Most locks are Average (one success) to pick, if proper tools are at hand. Quality locks, lack of tools, 
			or adverse conditions will increase this difficulty.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3">M</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Music">Music (Heart)</p>
			<p>The Character is skilled at singing or playing a particular type of musical instrument. Those with a higher 
			Skill rating can perform more complex music. A Character may be required to make Checks when putting on an 
			important show in front of a significant audience, or when required to perform an especially difficult piece 
			of music.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3">N</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Navigation">Navigation (Tenacity)</p>
			<p>Navigation is the process of monitoring and controlling the movement of a ship from one place to another. 
			It is also the term used for the specialized knowledge used to perform navigational tasks, which involve 
			locating the navigator’s position in conjunction to known locations.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Negotiation">Negotiation (Heart)</p>
			<p>The Character with this Skill understands the procedures and tactics of negotiations between people, 
			groups, and states. In practice, a Check should be attempted at key points in a negotiation or diplomatic 
			encounter. Success means the encounter turns favorably for the Character. Failure means that the Character 
			may need to give some concessions. Depending upon the importance of the issues and the stubbornness of her 
			adversary, the exchange could go on lengthily with many Checks.</p>
			
			<p>If a Character has occasion to properly assess her opponent’s weaknesses, she gains up to a –2 modifier to 
			the pertinent Negotiation Checks. Such assessment may require roleplaying and the use of any number of Skills 
			like Information Gathering, Falsehood, or many possible others.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3">O</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Occultism">Occultism (Sagacity)</p>
			<p>This is the knowledge of the arcane, the supernatural and the sorcerous, the professional knowledge of 
			sorcerers and those intimate with their ways.</p>
			
			<p><em><strong>It cannot be learned if the character has neither an Asset nor a Talent choice suggesting 
			such familiarity.</strong></em></p>
			
			<p>The Skill entails a degree of knowledge of mythical famous sorcerers, dead and living, and their exploits, 
			as well as concrete knowledge of what sorcery is and isn’t capable of. It also grants understanding of 
			exactly how sorcery works (to the extent that this is understood at all). Depending on the setting, it 
			provides knowledge of supernatural beings like demons - their names, spheres of influence, attributes, and 
			other purported information about them.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_OmenReading">Omen Reading (Heart)</p>
			<p>Often performed for profit, Omen Reading allows a Character to determine general information about his 
			future or that of another person. </p>
			
			<p>Fortune telling methods vary with each culture. Examples include: throwing bones, palm reading, astrology, 
			tarot cards, reading tea leaves, visions brought on by drugs, dreams, and signs from gods, gaining insight 
			from dead ancestors, and many others. Usually fixed around a celestial event, a reading’s insight may span 
			the minimum of a day, or it may cover the time to the new moon, the next week, or until the group reaches 
			the next town. However, Omen Reading never provides exact information about an event at an exact time.</p>
			
			<p>The information provided by Omen Reading is often general and vague, such as “ill luck will come to 
			those that travel during the next two days” or “with great chances come great rewards in your near future” 
			or “the man in white has a forked tongue.”</p>
			
			<p>Omens are the Game Masters creations, but it is up to the Characters to determine their meaning. The GM 
			should put real effort into making each omen meaningful for the Characters, without giving away too much 
			information.</p>
			
			<p>To use this Skill, the Character identifies the person or people for whom he wishes to perform a reading, 
			during which he will make a Skill Check.</p>
			
			<p><em><strong>This Skill is available only to Characters created with Talent Table “Sorcery” choices of 
			A-C.</strong></em></p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_PickPockets">Pick Pockets (Cunning)</p>
			<p>This Skill allows a Character to secretly palm an object or plant one onto another person, or to covertly 
			manipulate objects in the presence of others. Using this skill one could, for example, steal coins from a 
			target’s pouch, a ring from a finger, a dagger from a sheath, or plant a stolen object on a target to frame 
			her. This Skill could be employed to secretly swipe an item off a table or slip poison into someone’s 
			drink.</p>
			
			<p>When using this Skill in front of observers other than the target, the Challenge rating increases by one 
			level for every two people that might potentially see the Pick Pocket attempt.</p>
			
			<p>Note: in larger groups, depending upon what is happening in the surrounding area, it is unlikely that 
			everyone would have their attention focused towards the thief and her target. A significant distraction, such 
			as a performer on a stage in front of a crowd, would draw almost everyone’s attention, allowing an easy 
			harvest for a thief. </p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Precog">Precognition (Cunning)</p>
			<p>A Character with this Skill has the uncanny ability to sense danger a moment before it occurs. Whenever 
			the character is asked to make a Surprise Check, he may choose to roll a Precognition Check first. One Success 
			does away with the need for the Character to roll for Surprise. Two Successes gives the Character time to warn 
			his closest team mate.</p>
			
			<p>Three Successes afford these bonuses, and an indication of the direction from whence the danger is coming. 
			Four Successes allow adequate time to warn all of the Character’s teammates of the danger, thus completely 
			negating the Surprise. Finally, five Successes would indicate the nature and origin of the danger a full Round 
			before it occurs.</p>
			
			<p>There is no penalty for a failed Precognition Check.</p>
			
			<p><em><strong>This Skill is available only to Characters created with Talent Table “Sorcery” choices of 
			A-C.</strong></em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3">R</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Riding">Riding (Daring)</p>
			<p>This Skill enables a Character to control a mount of a specific type. If she wishes to control another 
			type of mount, she will need time to familiarize herself with it, until which time all Skill Checks for the 
			new mount are one Challenge level more difficult.</p>
			
			<p>A Character with this Skill can keep control of an animal at a full gallop without a Skill Check, or roll 
			a Check to calm a startled animal. With a Check modified for difficulty, the Character can direct her mount 
			to leap obstacles and perform other tricks. A successful skill Check allows the Character, in combat, to 
			mount or dismount without penalty. If this Skill Check fails, additional time for mounting or dismounting 
			is required, however this incurs no additional cost.</p>
			
			<p>To guide an animal in combat the character must spend a Melee Pool die during any round in which she wishes 
			to change direction or speed of movement, as, having established these, the animal is considered to continue 
			along in that direction and at that speed until the Character chooses to change either. This does not require 
			a Skill Check.</p>
			
			<p>Any attack that causes damage to an animal requires the Character, in order to maintain control of it, to 
			spend an additional Melee Pool die as well as make a successful Skill Check. If is the Check is failed, the 
			rider will be thrown from the mount, and the animal will run until calmed in a following round. Also a penalty, 
			appropriate to the amount of damage done, is awarded.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3">S</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Seamanship">Seamanship (Tenacity)</p>
			<p>Skilled in operating ships and boats, a Character with Seamanship is adept in all aspects of vessel 
			management from stringing rigging, organizing the crew’s jobs, repairing canvas and hulls, to steering and 
			rowing.</p>
			
			<p>A penalty may apply to the Skill Check if the ship or boat encounters rough waters. Especially harsh storms 
			may require up to three additional Successes, making them treacherous to all but the most seasoned sea 
			captain.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Seduction">Seduction (Heart)</p>
			<p>While it is possible for a Character without Seduction to have a romantic relationship, one skilled in the 
			arts of romance, enticement, and the seduction of those in whom he is interested is far more adept at 
			successfully pursuing others, including those who may be hesitant. He knows the right things to say, when to 
			make eye contact, and how to lie to succeed in his courtship. Seduction can be used to entice those who might 
			benefit the Character or his ambitions. Thus the use of this Skill includes cool calculation, feigned emotions, 
			and allusions, or outright promises.</p>
			
			<p>In practice, the Character describes his methods and motives for wooing his subject and rolls a Skill 
			Check, adjusted for difficulty. Seduction takes time, and the higher the Challenge Level, the longer it will 
			take. If the Character is trying to convince his subject to do something that they would not normally do, the 
			subject may contest the attempt with Tenacity or their own Seduction Skill. Continuous failure of a Skill Check 
			against the same target will only increase the Challenge Level, as well as the subject’s annoyance with the 
			Character, until the Checks begin automatically to fail.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Sneaking">Sneaking (Cunning)</p>
			<p>A Character with this Skill has the ability to obfuscate herself and her movements, and to survey her 
			surroundings to find the best places to hide. She understands how other people will see and move through an 
			area, and knows how to create minor disturbances to distract them. Most importantly, she knows how to position 
			and fit her body to into small hiding spots and move silently between them. A Character with this Skill can 
			hide behind something which provides less than complete cover.</p>
			
			<p>To use this Skill, the Character rolls a Skill Check, with the Challenge Level based on the amount of 
			coverage available and vigilance of others in the area. The Skill Check is rolled when the Character first 
			moves into a concealed position, and again with each movement.</p>
			
			<p><em>This Skill cannot be used to hide from others that are already aware and within vision of the 
			Character.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Soldiering">Soldiering (Tenacity)</p>
			<p>This incorporates the professional skills of all soldiers, including low-level organizational decisions 
			such as how and where best to set up camp, how and where to station guards, estimating the size of an enemy 
			body by the size of its camp, judging the quality of a troop by watching it perform, executing drills, 
			drawing up formations, and a variety of other tasks.</p>
			
			<p>More importantly, this Skill entirely replaces weapon Proficiencies in any battlefield setting in which 
			fighting is in a cramped, closed formation, such as a shield wall. In any such situation, a weapon Proficiency 
			functions at 20% of it’s normal value, but Soldiering can be used in its stead, no matter what the weapon. If a 
			Character breaks rank to fight alone – endangering both himself and his comrades – his Proficiencies are 
			no longer penalized, but he cannot use Soldiering in their stead.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Survival">Survival (Cunning)</p>
			<p>Survival provides the Character with the ability to find food, water, and shelter in any environment. She 
			has knowledge of the harsh conditions in all of them, and can plan ahead by packing the proper provisions. She 
			has a general idea of the risks posed by the creatures, plants and terrain of a given environment, and can 
			take precautions to avoid them.</p>
			
			<p>Additionally, this Skill helps the Character maintain a sense of direction and to navigate unknown 
			wildernesses and other surroundings. This is important to any explorer travelling overland without the 
			benefit of a road, or delving into the twisted caverns of the underworld.</p>
			
			<p>If she arrives in a location that she does not recognize, she can use Survival to get her bearings and a 
			general idea of the direction in which she needs to head to reach a familiar destination. She will also be 
			able to retrace her steps in a confusingly arranged environment. </p>
			
			<p>As well as skill in determining direction, Survival equips the Character to estimate distance, travel 
			time, and to recall important landmarks along the way. The Character must have some method of orientation, 
			such as the sun, stars, a compass, or known landmarks (ex. a mountain in the distance). Without such 
			directional indications, the Skill Check will be at least one Challenge Level more difficult than 
			otherwise.</p>
			
			<p>When this Skill is chosen, a Character is basically competent in all terrains and climates, but if she 
			encounters circumstances in which she has no previous first-hand experience, then all Survival tasks are one 
			Challenge Level higher in difficulty until three meaningful Survival Checks have been passed. Thereafter all 
			Survival Checks revert to their normal Challenge Level, and the Character is assumed to have familiarized 
			herself with the new environment.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Swimming">Swimming (Daring)</p>
			<p>Every hero in <em>Blade</em> can stay afloat and even swim clumsily, if unencumbered and in reasonably calm 
			waters. Swimming incorporates the skills to brave agitated waters under difficult conditions, to dive, to stay 
			afloat for extended periods, and to move at speed while in and under water.</p>
			
			<p>In combat, a Skill Check should be made once per Combat Round, with the swimmer’s Melee Pool for the Round 
			penalized by one die for every Success this Check falls short of.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3">T</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Theology">Theology (Sagacity)</p>
			<p>With this skill a Character has an intimate academic knowledge of his religion. Common areas of learning 
			include religious beliefs, temples, and cults of a chosen region and its surrounding area. This Skill is likely 
			acquired during academic education training at a religious school, and will likely be unknown to the majority 
			of priests.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Tracking">Tracking (Cunning)</p>
			<p>A Character with this Skill has the ability to follow the trail left by another creature by observing 
			clues in the environment – footprints, crushed grass, broken twigs, dropped items, bits of cloth or fur, and 
			other signs.</p>
			
			<p>To use the Tracking Skill, the Character rolls a Skill Check with a Challenge Level based on how 
			featureless she might find the surface of that trail. This Challenge Level is further adjusted by how old the 
			trail is and the current weather conditions. If the Check fails, the trail is considered gone.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Trailing">Trailing (Cunning)</p>
			<p>A Character with this Skill is proficient at covertly following another person or creature. (This is 
			different from the Tracking Skill because the target must be within sight when the character begins following 
			it.) To use Trailing, the Character begins by spotting the person or creature he wishes to trail before 
			performing a Skill Check. A successful Check of average difficulty (one success) achieves success for the 
			entirety of the chase, with the Character going unnoticed.</p>
			
			<p>Greater Challenge Levels occur only when passing through particularly open ground or especially deserted 
			environs. Initially failure results with being seen and remembered, though not automatically being recognized 
			as a tail.</p>
			
			<p>Once seen, a new Check is made for the remainder of the chase, and this Check is now Opposed with Trailing, 
			(or Cunning, doubling the required Successes needed if the target does not possess the Trailing Skill). Failure 
			of this Opposed Check will result in the trailer being revealed.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Trapping">Trapping (Cunning)</p>
			<p>A Character with this Skill can plan, set, find, and disable traps of all sorts. The primary ability within 
			Trapping is a predictive one: What path is the target likely to take? What will lure the target into the trap? 
			Where would I set a trap in this area?</p>
			
			<p>When planning and setting a trap, this Skill provides the ability to produce very basic devices, such as a 
			cover of branches and leaves for a pit in the forest. The damage incurred by a trap should be in accordance 
			with such devices.</p>
			
			<p>The Game Master secretly rolls the Skill Check for the Character setting a trap. Failing the Skill Check 
			could mean one of several things: the trap may be visible to the target, the trap may not go off as planned, 
			or the trap may accidentally spring while the Character is working on it. Success implies that the trap has 
			been properly set.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_MoreSkills">More Skills?</p>
			<p>The Skills listed above should suffice for the majority of campaigns and settings, but groups are encouraged 
			to create new Skills they feel are vital for their game. That said, some care should be taken because Skills 
			are a relatively expensive commodity when compared with Attributes. They must therefore be truly useful.</p>
			
			<p>Having a Skill or not should matter in a game situation. Things that do little more than add flavor or  
			flesh out a Character’s background should not be elevated to Skill status. For example, carousing, teamster, 
			fishing, or animal husbandry - although these doubtless require skill or at least talent and are probably known 
			to a number of Characters, they are unlikely to be important outside of rare instances. If something isn't 
			likely to be critical to the action of an adventure, it shouldn't be a Skill.</p>
			
			<p>Below follows two examples of additional Skills that might be suitable for some campaigns.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4">Charioteering (Daring)</p>
			<p>Charioteering may be relevant as a Skill in games where chariots fulfill a role in warfare, or in those in 
			which chariot races figure prominently. It involves proficiency at driving not just any old cart or wagon, 
			but an actual chariot, often under adverse conditions. Among other things, this Skill encompasses: use of 
			chariots on the battlefield, chariot racing, familiarity with all types of chariot and basic knowledge about 
			their construction, the ability to affect simple repairs, and the proper treatment of horses or whichever 
			animals pull the chariots.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4">Streetwise (Cunning)</p>
			<p>Replacing the Customs, Etiquette, and Information Gathering Skills in many underworld situations, this 
			Skill represents familiarity with criminal subcultures and everything that goes with them. Characters 
			proficient in this Skill know how to behave among members of the half-world, how to pass themselves off as 
			one of their number (if they are not already one), how to employ and read secret signs and codes, and the 
			usual criminal modus operandi of a location. Streetwise is a measure of the Character’s knowledge (who's-who 
			and what-is-what) of the under and half worlds’ criminal structures in any place he has spent some time.</p>
			
			<p>Streetwise is relevant as a Skill if a large part of the campaign is intended to be set in the urban 
			underworld and to revolve around it. Don’t bother making this into a Skill if the underworld serves merely as 
			a backdrop.</p>
