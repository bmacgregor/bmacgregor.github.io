			<p class="h2">A Guide to Choosing Skills</p>
			<p>Unlike other systems, the skill list in <em>Blade</em> should not be seen as a shopping-list. Essentially,
			Characters should only have skills that are <em>central to who they are</em>. Think of your Character as they
			might appear in a work of fiction. If the imaginary audience wouldn't <strong>immediately</strong> connect
			your character with a certain pursuit, then this skill should not be purchased, even if the Character is
			considered to have some knowledge of it. For instance, Indiana Jones probably has some knowledge of first-aid,
			but he's not known for being a combat medic, or wandering doctor. He probably doesn't have <em>Healing</em> as a 
			skill.</p>

			<p class="h4">An Example of Skill-Use</p>
			<p>If your Character has an attribute of four or higher, you shouldn't learn a skill at level one. That said, a 
			rating of two or higher in a skill is a different case.</p>
			
			<p>Suppose you need to make an average (one success) Skill Check, and you probably have Passion dice to add to 
			your roll; for the sake of example, let’s assume you have two. If you have an Attribute of four, you would roll 
			six dice (four for your Attribute, plus two for your Passion), needing two successes (that is, normally a 
			single success is required, but since you're rolling this using an Attribute instead of a Skill, the number of 
			successes is doubled).</p>
			
			<p>If you have a skill at level two, you would roll four dice (two for your skill, and another two for your 
			Passion), but you would only need a single success. Using your skills offer a better chance of success.</p>
		
			<p class="h4">What's the Difference?</p>
			<p>Here, the difference is no big deal; even though the odds are worse, they're still weighing heavily in the 
			Character’s favour, however, this matters for more difficult checks. In the same example, if two successes 
			would have been needed, then using a Skill would roll four dice for the needed successes, but using an Attribute 
			would roll six dice for <em>four</em> successes.</p>
			
			<p>As Characters will almost always have Passion dice to add to their Checks. Having a Skill a rating X will 
			<em>almost always</em> offer better chances of successes than having an Attribute at a rating of (2X + 1).</p>
			
			<p class="h4">Going Skill-Heavy</p>
			<p>Going Skill-heavy isn't a bad thing at all, <strong>provided that you don't purchase any Skill at ratings 
			below four</strong>. Again, only things that are central to the character concept and define the character 
			should be purchased as Skills.</p>
			
			<p>Placing an emphasis on your Character's skills makes them very effective in a number of limited pursuits — 
			provided you don’t squander your 33 or 48 points by purchasing a dozen Skills, all at level three. By putting 
			4+ (or better yet 6+) into a limited number of Skills define the Character and give them focus.</p>
			
			<p>While this is apparent from looking at the mechanics, it doesn’t say so anywhere in the rules. If your 
			Character is neither a keen mountaineer or a cat­burglar, Climbing isn’t purchased; similarly, if your 
			Character isn’t a a courtier, diplomat, or politician, Etiquette isn’t taken. If you don't envision your 
			Character fighting predominantly from horseback or making a living from riding, Riding isn’t purchased.</p>
