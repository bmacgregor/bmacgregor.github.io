				<li><p><strong>Go Get Some Books</strong></p>
				<p>Grab some Sword & Sorcery novels and read them. Encourage everyone in your group to read. Movies will do 
				if you’ve got no alternatives, but it isn’t the same.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>The Fray's the Thing</strong></p>
				<p>Combat is the heart of <em>Blade</em>, and the heart of combat is the maneuvering. Every attack in 
				combat should be detailed. Don't say “I kick the guy,” or “I swing at him.” Explain <em>how</em> you’re 
				doing it, and make it exciting! Visualize your Character as if he were on a movie screen, and use the 
				scenery and props to your disposal.</p>
				
				<p>Blade combat should be fast, fluid, and constantly jumping. The fun is based a mostly on how well you 
				and your friends pull this off.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Do it With Style</strong></p>
				<p>The Characters are action heroes. Everything should be done with flair, panache, and attitude. Remember, 
				you’re one of the big fish, so act like it.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Subtlety isn't a Virtue</strong></p>
				<p>Everything in <em>Blade</em> should be larger than life. This doesn’t just apply to the action either; 
				melodrama is a staple of Sword & Sorcery novels. Betrayal, loyalty, honor, and revenge are all common 
				themes, and should be played to the hilt. When a mortal enemy reappears, or your sweetheart is murdered, 
				don’t be lukewarm, that’s not interesting. This is your time in the spotlight — go nuts!</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Everyone Has a Past</strong></p>
				<p>Melodramatic hooks are not only one of the fundamental keys to defining your Character; they’re also a 
				fertile source for plot twists and surprises. Everyone has a past, and everyone has a purpose. Grab your 
				Passion Attributes and have a blast! Maybe you’re out for revenge, or maybe you’re out for redemption. 
				Maybe you’re looking for something, or you're in hiding. What matters is that you’re trying to do 
				something; the more defined, the better.</p>
				
				<p>With a little cooperation from both sides of the table, there’s always room to introduce long-lost 
				family or traitorous friends who are out to get you.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Don't Loot the Bodies</strong></p>
				<p>It’s crass. This may be a standard practice in other RPGs, but it just isn’t done in <em>Blade</em>. When 
				was the last time you read about a hero rifling through the bad guys’ clothes for a few coins? It’s 
				perfectly acceptable to search the bodies for vital clues, or to grab their weapons if you need them, but 
				loot is rarely an issue.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>The World is a Cliché</strong></p>
				<p>Nothing’s been done before that can’t be done again in <em>Blade</em>. The stronger the stereotype, the 
				better, so play it up. Villains always come with an army of henchmen, a secret fortress, and a nefarious 
				plan. Hermits are fonts of Zen-like wisdom, cynical guards are idealists at heart, and assassins always 
				have the soul of a poet.</p>
				
				<p>This doesn’t mean every character in your story should be a walking cliché, but you shouldn’t worry 
				about using them in your adventures either. However, don’t let your games become predictable. After all, 
				the best clichés are the ones that you put your own twist on.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>If it's Not Important, it's Off-Screen</strong></p>
				<p>Some GM's love to play out every situation the Characters get into. That’s fine for some RPGs, but not 
				for <em>Blade</em>. Mundanities should be dealt with quickly. Things like eating, sleeping, and shopping 
				should all take place off-screen. That said, sometimes the weekly trip to the market will be an opportunity 
				for your Characters to get vital information, or daily meditation in the shrine turns into a brawl. On 
				these occasions, the mundane gets some screen time, but otherwise, it can be glossed over.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>A Game in Motion Tends to Stay in Motion</strong></p>
				<p><em>Blade</em> is a game of action; keep things moving. Think of your game as a movie, and think about 
				what you do (and don’t) want to see on screen. Stick to pulp author Raymond Chandler’s school of thought: 
				“If things come to a standstill, have a couple of armed goons kick down the door”.</p>
				
				<p>Any <em>Blade</em> setting worth gaming in is a dangerous place, and attackers out of the blue raises 
				questions that can be investigated. This doesn’t mean the game should be one continuous battle, but you 
				should keep things moving along. Don’t let your players get bogged down with trivia or become indecisive. 
				Keep the arrows flying and the blades slinging!</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>It's Not <em>Just</em> About the Combat</strong></p>
				<p>A common criticism of the Sword & Sorcery genre is that it’s just about hack-and-slash. This is only 
				true if you let it be. Like all good action novels, what happens between the fights is as important as the 
				fights themselves. Drama, comedy, and complex plot twists are as much a part of <em>Blade</em> as the 
				action. Give your Players their story - a story they want to work through, and a chance to develop their 
				Character’s Passions. Endless fight scenes become dull and meaningless.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Mooks - Set Dressing That's Fun to Beat Up</strong></p>
				<p>Game Masters new to <em>Blade</em> could feel that unnamed characters die too easily, and ask “How can I 
				make them tougher?”. This is missing the point. Mooks aren’t supposed to be tough. Mooks, thugs, goons - 
				call them what you will - are meant to be cannon fodder for the Characters. However, this does <em>not</em> 
				mean that they’re harmless. Throw enough mooks at your Players, and they’ll eventually wear them down. It 
				also doesn’t mean that mooks can’t have a few interesting powers or use clever tactics. However, mooks are 
				the extras of the game, meant to augment your main villains, not replace them.</p>
				
				<p>The real challenge should be the named characters. We would even go as far as to say that a Wound Level 
				of 4 or greater should slay a mook. Instantly! This well reflects S&S heroes clearing out a crowded hall of 
				enemies!</p>
				
				<p>By the way, don’t worry about where all these mooks come from. Villains have an endless supply of losers 
				working for them. “Crunch all you want, we’ll make more.”</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Eat Your Mooks - They're Good for You</strong></p>
				<p>To emphasize the appropriate respect that Players should have for mooks (not much), keep bowls of hard 
				candies like Reese’s Pieces or M&Ms, and use them to represent mooks. The rule is simple: If you take down 
				a mook, you get to eat him. Unless one of your Players is diabetic, this is sure to get them into the 
				spirit.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Let Your Players Shine</strong></p>
				<p>The Characters are the heroes of your <em>Blade</em> novel — let them act like it. Most of what heroes 
				do in novels or movies would never work in real life anyway, so don’t apply the “real life” rule to your 
				Players. Characters regularly bend the laws of physics to do things. Roll with it. That said, don't let 
				the Players get away with things that are obviously impossible, or just plain stupid, but don’t trip them 
				up with rules technicalities or reality checks.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Let Your Players Fail</strong></p>
				<p>As a counterpoint to the above, resist the temptation to rig the game in favor of your Players. Make 
				them succeed on their own skills, smarts, and luck. If too much attention is paid to story concerns, your 
				game may appear faithful to the original stories in form, but it won't feel that way.</p>
				
				<p>The trick with presenting an uncaring Sword & Sorcery world is to referee it impartially and without 
				sentiment for the survival or well-being of the player characters. Some game theories espouse the concept 
				that PCs should be special and merit special consideration. Don’t do this. If they are to be special, it 
				should be through their own actions and by their already considerable capabilities against the hostile 
				milieu. So, no Plot or story Immunity! Blade Heroes can fail or even die — it happens in novels all the 
				time. Just be sure you give the players their shot at revenge later, and let them look good doing 
				it.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Great Villains Never Die; They Come Back in Sequels</strong></p>
				<p>The most memorable villains keep coming back. No matter how badly they seem beaten, they always bounce 
				back with a bigger army of goons, deadlier sorcery, a more impenetrable fortress, and an even more 
				diabolical plan.</p>
				
				<p>Always give your villain a hidden escape route, or at least an ambiguous death. If your Players are 
				enjoying it, they may help out with something like, “Well, that’s the last we’ll be seeing of old Thulsa. 
				After all, no one could have survived that fall.” Of course players, being the savvy (and bloodthirsty) 
				individuals that they are will still go to great lengths to make sure your villains are truly and 
				completely dead. That’s normal, and if you think the Players are getting tired of it, let the villain die. 
				He can always return as a cackling ghost if they miss him.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Paint a Picture</strong></p>
				<p><em>Blade</em> is a game that depends on visualization, more so than most other RPGs. The Players say 
				who they are and what they’re doing; it’s up to you to provide the rest. The better your description of the 
				scene, the Characters in it, and what they’re up to, the more creative your Players’ actions will be. More 
				than this, a vivid description brings a game to life, and is instrumental in introducing the Sword & 
				Sorcery feel to your Players.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Let the Players Roll the Dice</strong></p>
				<p>In large combats, Players often have little control over the outcome of events when it isn’t their turn 
				in the Limelight. This can lead to boredom if a Player’s attention drifts between turns, threatening to 
				distance them from the outcome of events.</p>
				
				<p>The best method of dealing with this problem is to put more dice rolling into your Players’ hands: 
				allow your Players to make all of the dice rolls in and out of combat. This takes a lot of the work out 
				of your hands since you no longer need to roll for Checks needed to administer the melee. This frees up 
				your attention for other important things, such as enemy tactics, spell effects, terrain, and the 
				like.</p>
				
				<p>Conversely, it requires the Players to become much more active and aware of what’s going on. No longer 
				can they snooze through all Limelights but their own: they’ll be rolling more dice than ever before — 
				which (among other benefits) gives them the feeling of having greater control over their successes and 
				failure. Plus, since you're <em>not</em> rolling the dice, you can’t fudge a result to give the Characters 
				a break (or take one away).</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Keep Your Villains on Their Toes</strong></p>
				<p>One major consideration for an arch-villain’s organization that is often overlooked is the infighting 
				that goes on between members. Any mook’s main goal in life should be to become the next Chief Lieutenant. 
				With this in mind, they should be willing to sell out their fellow mooks for a chance of advancement. This 
				can often be beneficial to Players who understand the value of a well-placed bribe. In turn, the Chief 
				Lieutenants should have to watch out for daggers from the shadows, and the Arch Villain himself has to keep 
				his Chief Lieutenants from becoming too powerful so they don't become a threat to their own schemes.</p>
				
				<p>It’s extremely dangerous to be in the Hierarchy of Evil. The road to the top is paved with knives.</p></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Give Your Encounter a Hook</strong></p>
				<p>Giving encounters an unusual element that will spark an immediate interest of your Players. If the 
				Players are interested, you can feed off of that and become energized to run a great encounter. A hook is 
				that special something that makes the encounter strange, new, exciting, puzzling or provoking:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>A fascinating location (on a narrow, crumbling bridge; above a massive spinning fan; in the 
					roaring, pounding surf)</li>
					
					<li>It could assail one of the senses (strobing light caused by strange fungi, intense heat from a 
					blazing fire, strange noises, weird lights, sudden temperature changes)</li>
				</ul></li>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<li><p><strong>Give Your Players Small Secrets</strong></p>
				<p>Play with plenty of small secrets in your game. Why does the prim and proper lady down the street go out 
				every Thursday at midnight, not to return until noon the next day? What’s that blue flickering light that 
				shines from a neighbor’s basement window at night? Why can’t you remember last Tuesday morning, anyway? 
				The “best” and most inspiring RPG material contains dozens of tiny, throw-away mysteries. Almost every 
				paragraph mentions some weird oddity, and doesn’t really explain it. These are small things - not secrets 
				that will change the nature of the universe. They give the Players something to play with.</p>
				
				<p>Small mysteries tend to be much easy to solve: You follow the proper lady. You sneak into the basement. 
				You ask people if they saw where you went last Tuesday morning. Not all mysteries involve webs of clues and 
				payoffs. Even someone who swears up and down that they hate mysteries may find some fun in hunting down the 
				easy answer to a small question. You’re no longer stuck with a choice between leaving mysteries out 
				entirely or alienating your Players. Have Fun!</p></li>

			<p class="h4" id="P_TheIronRule">Final Word : The Iron Rule</p>
			<p>These rules are yours, and you are invited to make them even more so by customising them to your heart’s 
			content. Add, change, and ignore what you like. There is, however, one rule that cannot be altered while 
			playing <em>Blade</em>. This is the Iron Rule. When we encourage “you” to make these rules your own, we are 
			referring to the gaming group, not just the Game Master. The gaming group has every authority to change the 
			rules; on their own, the GM has none. The game is owned, communally, by the group. If the GM wants to change, 
			ignore, or add a rule, he has to run this by his group. If the majority of the group (himself included as one 
			member among several with equal rights) repudiates this change, then the change can't be enacted.</p>
			
			<p>That said, the Game Master does have one special authority over the rules-  he can veto any rules change 
			proposed by any of the Players. It doesn’t matter if the majority of the group wants to change one of the 
			rules. If the GM isn’t comfortable with the change, the rule stands.</p>
