			<p>This chapter takes a look at the setting, protagonists, and the structure of a typical Sword & Sorcery tale. 
			It shows the common traits of the genre, and attempts to aid both Game Masters and Players alike in getting a 
			feel for the conventions of Sword & Sorcery, to better allow them to create settings and Characters that are 
			genre-appropriate.</p>
			
			<p>For the sake of demonstrating what the tales have in common, a degree of generalization is inevitable. 
			Please be aware that no writer has followed all of the tenets explained in this chapter; feel free to ignore 
			those that do not suit you, but please be aware that while you can (and should) deviate from a few precepts, 
			you will be rapidly abandoning the field of Sword & Sorcery if you veer too far from common Sword & Sorcery 
			tropes.</p>

			<p class="h4">The World of Sword & Sorcery</p>
			<p>A Sword & Sorcery world is almost always a harsh place, where violence and outright cruelty are commonplace. 
			The world (or the relevant part of it) may be outright lawless, but it need not be; if it is, it's usually 
			abound with pockets of lawless behaviour where might makes right, either because a central authority is 
			non-existent, too weak to keep the peace, or simply does not bother to do it. Callous regimes interested in 
			nothing but the perpetuation of their own power and comfort are typical, as well as regimes whose authority and 
			hold over their countries is undermined by contenders, rebels, war, raiders, or by the sheer size of the land 
			and the remoteness of the government.</p>
			
			<p>The majority of people in Sword & Sorcery stories usually do little to alleviate the harshness of the 
			violent world. Self-serving and callous people are common, and only a minority of people can be considered 
			altruistic – this isn't to say that the latter doesn’t exist - decent people do exist, and figure quite 
			frequently in Sword & Sorcery stories, but it's universally understood that they constitute the minority, and 
			figure as a device to throw the selfishness of the majority into stark relief.</p>
			
			<p>By and large, most people will have little interest in anything but their own advantage. Compassion is 
			limited, and rarely seen. Combined with this uncaring attitude, the abundance of violence, and the utter egoism 
			of the typical government make the Sword & Sorcery world into a tragic place. While most common people don't 
			course have to contend with the threat of a violent end on a daily basis, the menace of it is ever present in 
			the background. Almost everyone will have personally experienced situations where someone’s life was either 
			ruined or ended by rampant violence or the uncaring arbitrariness of people in power.</p>
			
			<p>It's typical that the people of the Sword & Sorcery world don't try to make their world a better place. The 
			response of the majority is to look after themselves and their own prosperity, or else outright fatalism. 
			Sometimes it's a combination of both.</p>
			
			<p>In extreme cases, such a combination might lead to an decadent world where everybody feels powerless in the 
			face of fate and looks to his or her own pleasure, while they wait for their turn for fate to strike them down. 
			This latter setting is a subset of the Sword & Sorcery world; a decadent, fatalistic, often sophisticated, 
			wicked and sybaritic place.</p>
			
			<p>It provides a distinctive flavour of its own, and therefore serves as the backdrop for cloak-and-dagger 
			tales that play in opulent pleasure palaces and dark back-streets of ancient metropolises. There is, of course, 
			nothing to keep a Game Master from providing his own Sword & Sorcery setting with different areas suffused 
			with either type of flavour; the savagely violent wilds and the wickedly depraved cities.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_FaithAndTheDivine">Faith and the Divine</p>
			<p>Almost all Sword & Sorcery settings lack a direct manifestation of the divine. Priests run the gamut, from 
			scholars to Machiavellian plotters to ritualists humbugging either themselves or their flock. They will never 
			– with one exceptions present – be recipients of any kind of supernatural power of a <em>divine</em> origin. 
			There are no “clerical spells”. Miracles are thus stuff of religious legend, with no game mechanics to regulate 
			the contingency of their appearance.</p>
			
			<p>Priests who receive power from their deities are usually the celebrants of evil, forbidden and secret cults. 
			Instead of actual clerics, they should be considered to be sorcerers receiving preternatural knowledge from 
			ultramundane patrons, typically at a cost.</p>
			
			<p>Religion in Sword & Sorcery can be monotheistic, but will more usually be polytheistic. Religious practices 
			are frequently steeped in convoluted ritual. Sacrificial rites are common. With the darker cults, this probably 
			includes human sacrifice. The faithful likely believe in divine intervention, but actual intervention is 
			exceedingly rare. If the gods do exist, they are remote and uncaring. When they do show their hands, it is more 
			likely that it will be to punish and cast down than to rescue and reward.</p>
			
			<p>Pantheons of gods that need to be appeased to spare humanity their wrath exist in Sword & Sorcery, but are 
			in the minority. While common people in the setting may well be deeply devout, the attitude of the Protagonists 
			tends to be deeply self-sufficient, with Characters likely trying to avoid the gods as much as possible.</p>
			
			<p>Most heroes of Sword & Sorcery respect divine power and will rarely insult it, but by and large avoid 
			treading on a deity’s shadow. Even exceptionally devout Protagonists feel that there is little use in turning 
			to a god for something one can, by sweat and supreme effort, achieve oneself. Even a Protagonist as deeply 
			religious as Howard’s Solomon Kane displays this latter attitude of self-reliance over hope in divine 
			agency.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_MagicAndTheSupernatural">Magic and the Supernatural</p>
			<p>Even though it is in the name of the genre, magic need not actually be real in a world of Sword & Sorcery. 
			In the rare cases where magic does not exist, it will still be universally believed in, generally to such a 
			degree that it might be preferable <em>not</em> to inform Players that it is rank superstition, and that magic 
			doesn't actually work.</p>
			
			<p>The default, however, is for magic to be real, but never commonplace. In Sword & Sorcery, true magic is 
			always rare. It is powerful, mysterious, and not completely understood even by its practitioners. Most of all, 
			it is menacing and strange to the point of being outright alien.</p>
			
			<p>Only seldom will magic work by drawing upon some anonymous force pervading the universe – usually the 
			source of magic is either a force or entity inimical to life or at least humanity. By working magic, the 
			sorcerer is endangering his sanity, soul, humanity, or even all of them. Acts of sorcery, especially the more 
			powerful ones, will often involve blood sacrifice and similar unpleasantries. Sorcerers in Sword & Sorcery 
			tales are rarely "good" guys – at best they're shady and ambiguous, and often they are outright hell-raising 
			fiends. Owing to the danger that sorcery represents to its practitioners, sorcerers are usually strong-willed 
			people with iron discipline; after all, it takes a certain kind of person to risk their life, and probably also 
			soul or sanity, and flirt with eternal damnation. This makes sorcerers the perfect villain of the Sword & 
			Sorcery tales, and only marginally suitable as Characters.</p>
			
			<p>Magic in Sword & Sorcery is universally subtle, and never worked quickly. Instead, it's the product of 
			lengthy rituals. Its effects are not obvious or necessarily magical to the onlooker, and are rarely flashy. The 
			sorcerer of this genre may converse with the dead, scry out distant places, magically enslave people to his 
			sovereign will, inflict wasting plagues upon those who irk him, command the weather, fool with hallucinations, 
			curse his enemies with terrible dooms, summon demons to do his bidding, and maybe even shake the very earth to 
			bring down entire cities. However, he will not throw lightning from his fingertips, nor mass-produce magical 
			weapons. Such items of power are invariably rare in tales of Sword & Sorcery, with most campaigns playing out 
			without a single magical item turning up. When magic items do exist, they are usually the stuff of legend and 
			are eminently powerful, on a level with Excalibur and the Holy Grail. Frequently , such things are cursed or 
			otherwise doom-laden. If they appear at all, they take center stage and are the focus of an adventure, or 
			better yet, a series of adventures.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_RacialMakeupOfS&S">The Racial Makeup of Sword & Sorcery</p>
			<p>With magic and the supernatural being so rare, it will not come as a surprise that non-human races are 
			equally rare in Sword & Sorcery. This is a world of humans, and while non-humans do exist, they are relegated 
			to legend and the fringes of the setting. Such beings are never commonplace, and do not integrate into human 
			society.</p>
			
			<p>Instead, they represent the uncanny, the alien, and the utterly inhuman. Bitter survivors of anterior races, 
			scattered communities plotting the eventual downfall of man, degenerated descendants of elder races preying 
			upon man, reclusive and solitary guardians of pre-human wisdom; these are the usual roles for non-humans in 
			Sword & Sorcery, but certainly not one of sharing the quintessentially human world with any degree of equality 
			or amicability. What non-humans figure in Sword & Sorcery are anything but humans with pointed ears; rather, 
			they are ultimately unfathomable, unknowable, and quintessentially <em>non</em>-human.</p>
			
			<p>Because of this, the role of the non-human in the Sword & Sorcery adventure is similar to that of magic 
			items, though to an even lesser degree. When one figures in an adventure, she will be central to it and much of 
			the adventure will revolve around her. The same applies to monsters, those well-loved enemies of role-playing 
			heroes. In Sword & Sorcery, they are ousted from this position. Here, the most common adversary of the 
			Characters are other people. Monsters occupy a similarly special place as non-humans. If they appear in 
			stories, they will not fulfil the role of the common orc, to be slaughtered in untold numbers, instead, they 
			appear like Grendel or Count Dracula does, the focus and backbone of an entire adventure or a recurring plot 
			device on the way to the climax. It follows that they usually appear alone, or at best in tiny, closely 
			connected groups. They are individual horrors, capable of single-handedly menacing all of the Characters in a 
			story – and slaying more than a few.</p>
			
			<p>In Sword & Sorcery, the role of non-humans and monsters is a similar one: Both represent an encounter with 
			the uncanny. Conan doesn’t typically fight through hordes of monsters the way he does hordes of men, nor do 
			Clark Ashton Smith’s various heroes. Even where Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser confront monsters with steel, it's 
			rare that they encounter them in great numbers. Elric is the exception, and even then only occasionally. Even 
			more recent Sword & Sorcery heroes, like Hercules or Xena, rarely battle more than one true monster at a time, 
			and they live in an <em>age</em> of monsters. In the few cases in the source literature where monsters appear 
			in groups, the hero’s solution is almost always to run, while villainous or simply less wary men are 
			slaughtered.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_HeroesAndVillains">Heroes & Villains</p>
			<p>The heroes of Sword & Sorcery come in many different shapes and sizes. Some, like Elric, are deeply 
			introspective intellectuals. Others, like Conan, are indomitable fighting men. Still more, like the Gray 
			Mouser, are sly bounders. Heroes like Cyrion are suave sophisticates, and others like Kane, are simply 
			bad-asses; with Myal Lemyal there is even an outright goofball among the heroes of the genre. The genre abounds 
			with many different types of protagonists, and by far not all them meet their opposition head-on and weapon in 
			hand. However divergent their method, outlook on life, and temperament may be, there are a few underlying 
			traits they have in common.</p>
			
			<p>The Sword & Sorcery hero is usually a stranger, outcast, or outlaw, an alien or a misfit in the region where 
			his tale plays out - set apart from the locale’s community. He is often, but not always, of humble descent, a 
			commoner, former slave, or outright barbarian. In cases where he hails from the higher classes of society he is 
			either discredited, disinherited, or irrevocably deposed from his once lofty position. He comes from the lowest 
			stratum of the upper class – the lowest of the mighty. He lives by brawn and cunning. His personal capabilities 
			are remarkable, and lift him head and shoulders above the masses. By their virtue, he imposes his own brand of 
			law on the desolate wilderness and sophisticated civilization. He is as gregarious, and as fond of 
			companionship as the next person, but at the end of the day he is his own man and utterly self-reliant. This 
			self-reliance typically extends to his attitude towards gods and the divine.</p>
			
			<p>While he may be a deep thinker and even an outright intellectual, he is always a man of action. When a 
			decision is called for, he does not hesitate or lose himself in doubt, but acts. This doesn’t mean that he 
			plunges head over heels into hasty action, but that he is unafraid to act. When circumstances call for it, even 
			a brooding Sword & Sorcery hero is be able to arrive at a decision and  have the guts to follow it through.</p>
			
			<p>As he exists in a harsh and violent world, the Sword & Sorcery hero is typically himself a harsh person who 
			does not shrink from violence – he has to be to survive, let alone prosper and further his goals. He well may, 
			like Solomon Kane, be utterly dedicated to the pursuit of selfless and ulterior motives, but if he is, he's 
			almost never “good” in the conventional sense of the world – too uncompromising would best describe the 
			righteous Sword & Sorcery hero; all too ready to dish out his own brand of summary justice, and incredibly 
			callous towards those he judges to be wicked.</p>
			
			<p>This type of hero is in the minority. The clear majority of Sword & Sorcery heroes are hardly heroic in the 
			conventional sense. They are the product of selfish and uncaring societies, and are usually ruthless and 
			self-serving. Only a few of them shrink from acts of savage violence, theft, and even outright murder. They 
			are out to make a living in a tragic, cruel, and unforgiving world, and are ready to do whatever it takes, by 
			means foul or fair.</p>
			
			<p>Nevertheless, there is a fine clear line that divides the hero from the villain, a line the hero will rarely 
			cross. Unlike the villain, the hero typically treats people the way they treat him. Strangers and enemies are 
			fair prey for whatever the hero deigns to visit on them, but his friends, companions, and those he has shared 
			danger with are exempt from the hero’s depredations, and will often find him a faithful friend who will treat 
			them fairly. This can even extend to respected and honourable enemies, who will normally be treated with a kind 
			of rough chivalry. As long as those close to the hero play fair by him, he will play fair by them.</p>
			
			<p>The Sword & Sorcery villain on the other hand will not shrink from stabbing someone in the back, even 
			companions who have never done him wrong, and this is what constitutes villainy in Sword & Sorcery: 
			Acknowledging no bounds to one’s self-serving behaviour, and being more than ready to treat everyone - even 
			friends and allies - as mere stepping stones on one’s own egoistic path.</p>
			
			<p>While the villain will readily prey on everybody, the hero will at least exempt friends and – this is 
			important – those he has shared danger with, from his own depredations. This is the dividing line. The hero, 
			as savage and maybe even cruel as he may be, is harsh and violent because that’s the way of a world where one 
			has to be strong and possibly without mercy. He will exempt those who have in not been part of the harshness 
			and violence of the world. The villain exempts nobody. All people, even those treating him with kindness and 
			consideration, are tools to him.</p>
			
			<p>Even though this is not necessary, Sword & Sorcery affords the Player the opportunity to portray true 
			bastards. However cold-blooded and callous a Character may be, it's of paramount importance that he doesn't 
			cross the line into the realm where he becomes a predator to all of humankind. A typical Sword & Sorcery hero 
			will often do some amoral, wicked, and outright vicious things, but this behaviour needs to be balanced with at 
			least some degree of decency on his part. If this decency is missing he totally lacks any redeeming quality. 
			Such a Protagonist is disgusting; watching his exploits lacking any glimpse of even vestigial propriety, and he 
			is hardly suitable to fulfil the role of the Protagonist of something that should, with all its grittiness, be 
			an entertaining pastime.</p>
			
			<p>If there is a single tenet of Sword & Sorcery that must not be broken it would be this: The hero, no matter 
			how depraved – and he need not necessarily be depraved at all – must never cross the line into completely 
			anti-social behaviour.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_TheS&STale">The Sword & Sorcery Tale</p>
			<p>It should hardly come as a surprise that Sword & Sorcery adventures are not about the exploits of heroes in 
			shining armour on white steeds, but rather about Protagonists out for their own reasons. In this genre, the 
			stakes tend to be personal.</p>
			
			<p>The Sword & Sorcery hero is never questing to save the world; instead, she is usually motivated by revenge, 
			trying to save her own butt, or out to make a splash. Many will be indifferent to the classic damsel in 
			distress. Consequently, the antagonists are typically not vicious people whose nefarious plans have to be 
			thwarted by the virtuous heroes. Often they are rivals who happen to be after the same goal as the heroes, who 
			want to thwart the heroes’ pursuit of this goal, or simply personal enemies trying to get back at them for some 
			real or perceived slight. Perhaps they are someone with whom the heroes unluckily cross paths.</p>
			
			<p>On occasion, the antagonist is someone from whom a hero has to protect people close to her, though such an 
			unselfish motivation is generally an exception. By and large, the hero is out to attain a goal that would be 
			of immediate benefit to herself (personal gain, survival, escape), or to aid a friend, but rarely if ever, are 
			they out to further the common good.</p>
			
			<p>As the supernatural is always rare in Sword & Sorcery, the majority of the antagonists will be human. When 
			non-human antagonists appear, they will be central to the adventure, in such a way that they are effectively 
			adventures in-and-of themselves, even when the object of the adventure isn’t to slay the monster. Where 
			non-human antagonists appear, a few points usually apply:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The monster is not necessarily there to be slain. (Though, to be sure, it probably can be. Monsters 
				tend to be as mortal) Often the objective is to <em>avoid being slain</em> by the monster</li>
				
				<li>The monster is formidable enough to challenge several Characters at once</li>
				
				<li>Most of the lesser (human) bad guys are not minions or cultists, but rivals of the Characters in 
				whatever goal they happen to pursue</li>
				
				<li>The monster’s lair is as dangerous to the lesser bad-guys as it is to the Characters. Quite a few of 
				them may well be slain through the monster’s agency</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>As is often the case with Sword & Sorcery gaming, horror provides a better model for stories than high 
			fantasy adventures. In the classic Sword & Sorcery tale, the monster is a series of foreshadowed dangers and 
			actual hazards that may - later in the game - blossom into an actual confrontation.</p>
			
			<p>The locales where Sword & Sorcery tales are set vary widely, but they are often exotic, and when not 
			desolate, resonate heavily with the flavour of the setting. Dangerous backstreets of wicked cities, a 
			countryside ravaged by war, the marble halls of opulent palaces, the encampment of a mercenary company, a 
			pirate ship on the high seas, a military encampment on the edge of civilisation, a caravan of slavers, a 
			squalid camp of refugees and the like are all be good examples.</p>
			
			<p>The second type of the locales are the desolate ones: Ruins of a lost civilisation, the abandoned temple of 
			a forbidden deity, an inimical wilderness, an island shown on no map, the spider-haunted crypt of an ancient 
			king, the forbidding lair of a legendary evil, and similarly hostile and mysterious places. These isolated 
			locales will more often be the setting for adventures revolving around non-human menaces who - by virtue of 
			being not integrated into human society - are usually found on the desolate edge of civilization.</p>
			
			<p>The exception to this are supernatural menaces that have been able to insinuate themselves into human 
			society, such as vampires or perhaps something inhabiting a temple and passing itself off as deity. Whatever 
			the locale of the Sword & Sorcery tale, it's never boring. It's exotic, colourful, and even terrifying, but 
			always an interesting place, though not one the wise would visit.</p>
			
			<p>The pace of Sword & Sorcery adventures is fast and furious, with rarely a scene lacking action or conflict. 
			Long stretches of quietude, where heroes gather information, or set up a convoluted intrigue, are absent from 
			this kind of adventure. Not every scene needs to have mad action – nor should it – but where it is absent 
			there should at least be a fair degree of tension, menace, or some kind of non-physical conflict. For example, 
			if a scene consists of nothing but conversation,it should be laden with veiled threats, undercurrents of 
			hostility, and other elements that add tension to an otherwise peaceful stretch of adventure. For the Game 
			Master, this means that she should avoid time to let the Characters stall, prepare, scout, chat, or otherwise 
			passing long spans of time in secure complacency. Events, namely those of the exciting, rousing kind, should 
			progress briskly, and if the Characters stray down a quiet side alley of the adventure, the GM should hit them 
			with unfolding events.</p>
			
			<p>The worlds of Sword & Sorcery aren’t safe places. They don’t wait for their heroes, and they certainly don’t 
			afford them opportunities to stall; if they do, events are likely to overtake them at a furious, 
			heart-throbbing pace. To convey this, the Game Master should use NPCs (especially villains) who don’t just sit 
			around and wait for the Characters, but who actively pursue their own agendas. If the Characters want to thwart 
			them, or beat them to some goal, they have to act decisively.</p>
			
			<p>This concludes the overview on Sword & Sorcery tales, and how <em>Blade</em> adventures should be run. At 
			the very end, once more a very quick checklist of the most important and elementary corner stones of the 
			genre:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Settings are harsh – various combinations of corrupt, violent, decadent, and callous</li>
				
				<li>Heroes are often - though not always - bastards, with most having reservations about being 
					<em>total</em> bastards</li>
				
				<li>Magic is mysterious, rare, powerful, and dangerous to its users but without flashy effects</li>
				
				<li>Supernatural and non-human beings rare and when they appear, they are central to the adventure</li>
				
				<li>Human opponents are often rivals in the pursuit of a goal</li>
				
				<li>Stakes in adventures are personal, not global</li>
				
				<li>Events in adventures progress at a fast pace</li>
			</ul>
