			<p>The Beat is an attack upon an opponent’s weapon or shield as an attempt to remove it temporarily. 
			<strong>Beats may only be performed at the start of a bout or following a “pause,”</strong>. This sudden, 
			brutal, and effective Maneuver is executed by declaring “Beat” as your offensive Maneuver, along with the dice 
			allotted to the attack. The defender assigns defense dice to a defensive Maneuver (Parry, Evade, Block, etc.) 
			and the contest is rolled normally. If the attacker wins the Beat, then the defender’s weapon (or whatever else 
			was being “Beaten”) is knocked aside and cannot be used in the following Exchange.</p>
			
			<p>Additionally, every success in the attacker’s Quality of Success costs the defender two Melee Pool die, and 
			functions similarly to Shock.</p>
			
			<p>If the defender wins, the round is resolved normally and initiative changes over. Using a Beat is an 
			excellent way to handle opponents with longer weapons as all Reach penalties are cut in half (.50 rounds up) 
			when Beating.</p>

			<p>This Maneuver uses off hand weapons (daggers, shields, etc.) to pin down or bind an opponent’s shield or 
			weapon, opening him up for a follow-up attack. With this Maneuver, an attack is rolled as normal with the 
			shield or off hand weapon, at the usual +1 Attack Target Number for attacking with the offhand.</p>
			
			<p>If using a shield to bind the opponent’s weapon, the Attack Target Number is six (6) for both bucklers and 
			large shields, and five (5) for small shields, without penalty for using the off hand. The defender can Evade 
			or use the weapon or shield that is being “Bound” to Parry or Block, but he may not use another weapon or 
			shield to defend against the Bind.</p>
			
			<p>If this attack is successful, the opponent cannot use the “Bound” weapon or shield on the subsequent 
			Exchange and he loses one Melee Pool die per point of Success, also good on the next Exchange. Thus, if Beat 
			were conducted with a Quality of Success of three (3), your opponent’s Melee Pool for the next Exchange is 
			reduced by three dice. If this would take the Melee Pool into the negative range, those negative dice are 
			added as bonus dice to the winner’s Melee Pool for the next Exchange, as usual.</p>

			<p>Disarming is a popular Maneuver when you are trying to avoid hurting your opponent or trying to make him 
			surrender, but it can just as easily be used as a prelude to an easy kill.</p>
			
			<p>A Disarm is performed in a similar manner to the Beat Maneuver, except that it is not necessary to perform 
			the Disarm after a break in the combat like a Beat. All Reach modifiers are halved (0.50 rounds up). The 
			attacker assigns as many dice to the Disarm as he likes (after paying the Activation Cost) while the defender 
			makes whichever defense he chooses. If the Disarm attack is successful, the defender must make a Knockdown 
			Check with a Difficulty equal to the attacker’s Quality of Success.</p>
			
			<p>If this Check is failed, then the weapon has been dropped. If the Knockdown Check is successful, then the 
			defender has managed to retain his grip on his weapon, <strong>but the attacker retains the role of 
			aggressor.</strong></p>

			<p>A double attack is the demanding action of attacking with one weapon in either hand on the same Exchange. 
			The Melee Pool dice allocated to the Exchange are first divided between the two attacks in any way the attacker 
			desires. Modifiers for Reach are applied, and then the attacks rolled as normal with the usual Attack Target 
			Number +1 penalty for using a weapon in the off hand. Your opponent will have a difficult time defending 
			against both your attacks, with viable defenses being only Evasion, Parry (if he has two weapons), or Block 
			and Parry (if he has both weapon and shield).</p>

			<p>This is a defensive measure that takes place during an attack (thus it counts as an offensive Maneuver). In 
			principle the attacker cuts with his weapon while simultaneously leaping backward so as to evade an opponent’s 
			attack. This Maneuver requires a great deal of skill, but it is indispensable to those who find themselves in 
			quick-draw style duels with opponents that go straight for the attack.</p>
			
			<p>To execute this Maneuver <strong>one attacks as normal with a slashing-type attack</strong>, spending this
			Maneuver’s Activation Cost in addition to the normal Activation Cost of the attack.</p>
			
			<p>If the optional Encumbrance rules are being used, a further Activation Cost equal to the Encumbrance score 
			must be paid, as per an Evasion.</p>
			
			<p>Once the Maneuver is activated, any number of additional dice may be spent to raise an opponent’s Attack 
			Target Number by one per additional die spent. On the downside, your own Attack Target Number also rises, 
			though only by one for every two additional dice spent (round up all fractions of .50 and above) – it’s hard 
			to hit an opponent when you’re going the other way...</p>
			
			<p><strong>This Maneuver is impossible to use in conjunction with any Thrust-based Maneuver.</strong></p>
					
			<p><em>This Maneuver is available at Proficiency level 4.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_OFF_FeintNSwing">Feint & Swing</p>
			<p>This is a relatively difficult trick to perform, and has a higher Activation Cost than Feint & Thrust. It 
			involves swinging at one region of the body, then changing direction mid-swing in an effort to bypass the 
			defender’s defenses entirely.</p>
			
			<p>Once the Activation Cost is paid (see below), any number of dice may be added to the attacker’s hand <em>at a 
			cost of one Melee Pool die for every additional die rolled in the attack</em>. A Feint is always declared 
			<strong>after</strong> the defender declares defense, but before dice are rolled.</p>
			
			<p>It’s important to note that a Feinted attack lands in a different spot than originally declared. The 
			attacker must also state the new location of attack (within no more than two Target Zones of the original 
			attack). <strong>The Activation Cost is equal to the “distance” from the original to the ultimate Target 
			Zone</strong>, (ex. either one or two).</p>
			
			<p>When used against the same opponent Feints have a tendency to lose their novel effect after a while. Each 
			repeated <em>identical</em> Feint against a single opponent, in the same location (over any number or duels — 
			not just one), costs an extra Melee Pool die to execute.</p>
					
			<p><em>This Maneuver is available at Proficiency level 3.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_OFF_FeintNThrust">Feint & Thrust</p>
			<p>This is among the first “tricks” that most swordsmen learn. Like the Feint & Strike it begins with a false 
			swing, in this case always either overhand or across, but finishes with a Thrust to the head, neck, or 
			torso.</p>
			
			<p>This Maneuver is executed almost identically to the Feint & Swing. When attempting a Feint & Thrust, the 
			attacker declares a Slashing attack aimed at Target Zones 3, 4, or 5, complete with Melee Pool die expenditure. 
			The defender then declares her own defense — <strong>if this defense isn’t based on the Parry Maneuver, Feint & 
			Thrust cannot be executed</strong> and the aggressor has to stick with her originally declared Swing type 
			offense.</p>
			
			<p>If the Maneuver can proceed, the attacker now states that he is Feinting & Thrusting and adds any number of 
			Melee Pool dice to her pool <em>at a cost of one die thrown away for every one added to the attacking hand</em> 
			(as per Feint & Strike). She also declares a new Target Zone for his Thrust, which must be zones 11, 12, or 
			13.</p>
			
			<p>Feints have a tendency to lose their novel effect after a while when used against the same opponent. Each

			<p>The basics of this Maneuver are governed by many Proficiencies. It consists of grabbing the opponent, 
			removing any weapon he wields, and changing the bout from free-flowing combat into a wrestling match, with 
			the purpose of immobilizing the opponent, throwing him to the ground or breaking his limb.</p>
			
			<p>The Activation Costs assume that the Grapple Maneuver is launched against an opponent’s limb, specifically 
			the primary attacking limb if the Maneuver is used defensively. In this instance (and only then), it may be 
			targeted against other parts of the body, for instance the torso or the head, but its Activation Cost is in 
			this case increases by +1. Reach modifiers apply to use of the Maneuver, which of course has a Reach range of 
			Hand.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_GrappleOne">			
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Using Grapple to defend against a Longsword (Reach Long) by attempting to 
				grab the opponent’s weapon arm carries an additional Activation Cost of +4 (+3 for Reach, +1 for 
				defending against a weapon).</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>The Grapple’s Target Number is invariably 7. If used successfully, a hold is established on whichever part 
			of the body is targeted. <strong>After a successful Grapple, both combatants find themselves in a 
			clinch</strong> at the Reach range of Hand.</p>
			
			<p>Until the clinch is broken, both opponents must use Melee Pool dice from their Wrestling Proficiency. Should 
			the clinch be entered mid-Round when another Proficiency – one other than Wrestling - was being used in the 
			first Exchange, Melee Pools are recalculated for the second Exchange based on Wrestling Proficiency, with dice 
			spent in the first Exchange subtracted from the Wrestling Pool.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_GrappleTwo">			
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: On Exchange One, Character A attacked with six (6) dice from his Longsword 
				Melee Pool but met with a successful defense in a grapple. He is now in the clinch. With Reflex five (5) 
				and Wrestling four (4) he has a Wrestling Melee Pool of nine (9) dice. Having spent six dice in Exchange 
				One, he now has three (3) Melee Pool dice remaining for Exchange Two.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>Once the clinch is established, the aggressor, receives a number of bonuc dice to his Melee Pool equal to
			the Quality of Success of the Grapple Maneuver, and now has three options:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li><p><strong>Immobilize</strong>: The aggressor tries to improve his initial hold in such a way as to 
				completely immobilize his opponent. This may require several Exchanges of wrestling.</p>
				
				<p>The aggressor assigns Melee Pool dice and, without paying any Activation Cost, checks against a Target 
				Number of seven (7). If he is beaten by the opponent’s defense, the hold is broken and combat returns to a 
				normal melee at a range of Hand, with the former defender now the aggressor.</p>
				
				<p>If the defense is tied or overcome, the victor’s Quality of Success is subtracted from the opponent’s 
				Melee Pool for the next Exchange. If this leads at any time to one combatant beginning a Combat Round with 
				a Melee Pool of zero (0) or less, the defender is immobilized and unable to break free until circumstances 
				change significantly.</p></li>
				
				<li><p><strong>Throw</strong>: The aggressor tries to throw her opponent to the ground. To do so, she 
				assigns Melee Pool dice and rolls her Opposed Check. The Target Number is six (6) if the initial hold was 
				on a leg, or eight (8) if the hold is on the torso, head, or arm.</p>
				
				<p>If the defense against the throw is successful, the hold is broken and the previous defender becomes 
				the new aggressor at a Reach range of Hand.</p>
				
				<p>In case of a tie, the clinch is broken and the combat continues at Reach range Hand, but without a 
				change of aggressor.</p>
				
				<p>If the aggressor is victorious, the clinch is broken and he remains the aggressor, but the opponent is 
				thrown to the ground, with all the attendant penalties of being prone.</p></li>
				
				<li><p><strong>Break</strong>: The aggressor attempts to break the limb he has grabbed. To do so, he 
				assigns Melee Pool dice and rolls them in an Opposed Check. His Target Number for this roll is seven (7) if 
				an arm is grabbed, eight (8) for a leg, and nine (9) for the neck. This is opposed by the defender’s 
				assigned Melee Pool dice.</p>
				
				<p>If the defender is victorious, the clinch is broken, and he becomes next Exchange’s aggressor at a Range 
				of Hand. If the roll is tied, the outcome is identical to a tied attempt to immobilize.</p>
				
				<p>If the aggressor is victorious, the aggressor and defender immediately make an Opposed Brawn Checks, 
				with the aggressor receiving his Qulaity of Success as bonus dice for the roll. If the aggressor wins with 
				a Quality of Success of at least two (2), the limb is broken. If this is the neck, the wound is fatal.</p>
				
				<p>For any other limb, refer to the Blunt Swing Damage Tables, Zone 1 for broken legs and Zone 7 for broken 
				arms. Roll d6 on the Table for Zone 1 or 7 and apply the result of a level four (4) wound to the exact

			<p class="h4" id="P_OFF_Half-Sword">Half-Sword</p>
			<p>This is one of the few practical ways to kill an armored opponent in full harness (full plate) with a sword. 
			Used with long swords, hand-and-a-half swords, and other longer weapons, the Half-Sword technique is performed 
			by grasping the blade of the sword with the off (usually left) hand in order to use the sword as a short 
			spear or pole-weapon. This technique is particularly useful in close-quarters when swinging a long weapon 
			may be impractical.</p>
			
			<p>Half-Swording reduces a sword’s effective Reach by one or two steps - from Long to either Medium or Short - 
			at the player’s discretion. Note that the Half-Sword may be released into a one-handed attack at any time, 
			nullifying any Half-Sword bonuses, but gaining Reach.</p>
			
			<p>Half-Swording precludes the sword being used for slashing, but it increases control over the weapon, lowering 
			both Defence Target Numbers and Thrust Attack Target Numbers by one (1). The latter effectively increases 
			damage dealt. Against any type of armour, Half-Swording it also raises the Thrust Damage Rating by +1.</p>
			
			<p>One can shift from normal grip to the Half-Sword at any time, though doing so during an Exchange 
			(shifting suddenly into or out of the Half-Sword in order to execute a particular counter, for example) costs 
			one Melee Pool die.</p>

			<p>Many polearms and axes are capable of hooking an opponent’s limb or head. This Maneuver is executed like 
			a Thrust that intentionally misses, and the shaft is pressed against the target and pulled. It is 
			particularly effective on the legs, causing one’s opponent to fall and become prone.</p>
			
			<p>After spending the Activation Cost (usually one), allot dice for a regular Thrust-like attack. The hooked 
			party Checks Knockdown with a Challenge Level equal to the aggressor’s Quality of Success. Failure drops him to 
			the ground, which halves the prone opponents Melee Pool due to being prone.</p>

			<p>The jewel of the art of fighting is the Master-Strike, a type of attack that both defends and offends in

			one weapon.</p>

			<p><strong>This Maneuver is only available for swords and similar weapons</strong> and is utilized to overcome 
			opponents too heavily armored to have a realistic chance to wound them using a blade. It is performed with the 
			sturdier types of either one- or two-handed swords. To execute it, the attacker grips the sword by the 
			blade to forcefully beat the opponent in the head with the grip, pommel, or crossguard of the sword. 
			<em>Gripping the sword by the blade reduces the effective Reach of the weapon by one increment</em>.</p>
			
			<p>The attack itself is a swing typically directed at the head, targeting areas 4 or 5. Damage from a 
			successful hit is calculated with a Damage Rating of +1 Blunt. In addition, if the head (and not just the 
			shoulder or arm) is struck, the attendant Shock rating is increased by a number equal to half the attacker’s 
			total of (Quality of Success + half Brawn + Damage Rating) before the defender’s Brawn and Armor Value are 
			subtracted - as with any other Bash to the head.</p>
			
			<p>This Shock even applies if no actual wound is caused, also as usual for Bashes to the head.</p>

			<p>Characters using this maneuver can attack with a Cut, Bash, or Parry <strong>with any weapon of Medium Reach 
			or shorter</strong>. Because the curvature of a weapon makes this Maneuver easier, straight-bladed or 
			hafted weapons of Medium or longer Reach require an additional 1 Melee Pool over the normal Activation Cost. 
			Weapons with a Reach of Hand and Short need no such curvature, and can be quick-drawn with no penalty.</p>
			
			<p>Weapons of Long Reach and shorter can also benefit from this Maneuver by making a sudden thrusting attack 
			with the pommel or butt end of the weapon. This has no additional cost, but its statistics differ than the 
			parent weapons: the attack has a Reach of Hand, and is a Thrust Attack with a Target Number of six (6), 
			and a Damage Rating of –1 Blunt.</p>
			
			<p>In all cases, the weapon being quick-drawn is assumed to be at the hip or in some other very accessible 
			place.  For those weapons carried in less accessible places - such as a boot knife or short weapon over the 
			shoulder - add 1 Melee Pool die to the Activation Cost (compounding with any other penalties or modifiers). 
			Weapons in packs or other immediately inaccessible places are just that; inaccessible.</p>
			
			<p>To perform this Maneuver, declare which weapon is being quick-drawn at the beginning of any Exchange 
			(usually the first, but not necessarily), and state whether it is being used to Cut, Bash, or Parry.</p>
			
			<p>After spending the Activation Cost and allowing for any penalties, a Terrain Check is made against the 
			weapons normal Attack Target Number -1 (if the drawing hand is free) or Attack Target Number -2 (if the 
			drawing hand is on the weapon’s grip already). If this Terrain Check is successful, the attack goes forward 
			normally, using standard attack rules. The weapon will be free for the next Exchange.</p>
			
			<p>This Maneuver can be combined with the rules for initiative and stealing it. Likewise, don’t forget to use 
			Reach rules here, including those rules for getting inside of a weapon’s Reach, or this Maneuver will lose 
			much of its bite.</p>

			<p>This Maneuver consists of leaping or stomping at an opponent, and then halting suddenly to throw him off 
			guard. To execute the Maneuver, pay the Activation Cost and then roll an Opposed Check of the attacker’s

			additional dice from his Melee Pool to lower the Target Number for this Check on a one-for-one basis, up to

			opponent and making him lose Melee Pool dice.</p>
			
			<p>To execute this Maneuver, the aggressor pays any Activation Cost and then assigns dice from her Melee Pool

			<p>Disarming is a popular Maneuver when you are trying to avoid hurting your opponent or trying to make her 
			surrender, but it can just as easily be used as a prelude to an easy kill.</p>
			
			<p>As a defense the Disarm Maneuver is performed in a similar manner to a Parry. Perfect timing is required, 
			as the defender must wait for the attack to come and sweep her attacker’s weapon aside at the optimal moment, 
			twisting it out of her hands. Unlike other defences, Disarm incurs a Reach penalty, such as an offense, if 
			it is attempted against longer weapons, but only half the usual ones (0.50 rounds up). After the Activation 
			Cost has been paid, dice are assigned as if for a Parry. If the defense is successful, the attacker must 
			make a Knockdown Check with a Difficulty equal to the defender’s Quality of Success.</p>
			
			<p>Failure in the Knockdown Check means that the attacker has instead been disarmed. Whether the attacker 
			drops his weapon or not, the defender now takes initiative. Of course, if the attacker wins, then the Disarm 
			attempt has failed and the attack goes through (minus the defender’s Quality of Success, as usual).</p>

			<p>The basics of this Maneuver are governed by many Proficiencies. It consists of grabbing the opponent, 
			removing any weapon he wields, and changing the bout from free-flowing combat into a wrestling match, with 
			the purpose of immobilizing the opponent, throwing him to the ground or breaking his limb.</p>
			
			<p>If used defensively against any attack other than an unarmed one, the Activation Cost is increased by +1. 
			Also, Reach modifiers apply to both offensive and defensive use of the Maneuver, which of course has a Reach 
			range of Hand.</p>
			
			<p>The Grapple’s Target Number is invariably 7. If the Maneuver is successfully used defensively, a hit is not 
			only avoided, but a hold on the opponent’s weapon arm is also established. If successful, the defender is now 
			the agressor. If the defender ties, they remain on the defense. After a successful Grapple both combatants 
			find themselves in a clinch at the Reach range of Hand.</p>
			
			<p>Against an opponent grappling, the defender is assumed to be in a clinch. Until the clinch is broken, both 
			opponenets must use Melee Pool dice from their Wrestling Proficiency. Should the clinch be entered mid-Round 
			when another Proficiency – one other than Wrestling - was being used in the first Exchange, the Melee Pool is 
			recalculated for the second Exchange based on Wrestling Proficiency, with dice spent in the first Exchange 
			subtracted from the Wrestling Melee Pool.</p>
			
			<p>An attempt to break out of an opponent’s hold is one’s defence against attempts to immobilize, throw, or 
			break a limb, which is a defensive Maneuver, free of any Activation Cost. The defender simply assigns dice 
			from his Melee Pool and, checks them against a Target Number of seven (7).  Victory in this contest usually 
			signifies the breaking of the clinch and a switch of the roles of aggressor and defender. However, this may 
			vary according to the actual wrestling attack defended against.</p>
			
			<p>Alternatively, a grabbed opponent may choose to forego any attempt to break the enemy’s hold on him and 
			simply attack him instead. He cannot use the limb that is being held for such an attack, and the Melee Pool for 
			attacks with another part of the body are modified by –1/2 Melee Pool due to the awkwardness of having one’s 
			freedom of movement restricted by the hold.</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_DEF_Half-Sword">Half-Sword</p>
			<p>This is one of the few practical ways to kill an armored opponent in full harness (full plate) with a sword. 
			Used with long swords, hand-and-a-half swords, and other longer weapons, the Half-Sword technique is performed 
			by grasping the blade of the sword with the off (usually left) hand in order to use the sword as a short 
			spear or pole-weapon. This technique is particularly useful in close-quarters when swinging a long weapon 
			may be impractical.</p>
			
			<p>Half-Swording reduces a sword’s effective Reach by one or two steps from Long to either Medium or Short, at 
			the Player’s discretion. Note that the Half-Sword may be released into a one-handed attack at any time, 
			nullifying any Half-Sword bonuses, but gaining Reach.</p>
			
			<p>Half-Swording precludes the sword being used for slashing, but it increases control over the weapon and 
			thus lowers both Defence Target Numbers and Thrust Attack Target Numbers by one (1). The latter effectively 
			increases damage dealt. Against any type of armor, Half-Swording it also raises the Thrust Damage Rating 
			by +1.</p>
			
			<p>One can shift from normal grip to the Half-Sword at any time, though doing so during an Exchange 
			(shifting suddenly into or out of the Half-Sword in order to execute a particular counter, for example) costs 
			one Melee Pool die.</p>

			<p>The jewel of the art of fighting is the Master-Strike, a type of attack that both defends and offends in 
			one motion. The technique, as it applies to <em>Blade</em>, can be used either as an offensive or defensive 
			Maneuver. In many ways it resembles the Simultaneous Block/Strike Maneuver, however it involves only one 
			weapon.</p>
			
			<p>The defender declares a Master-Strike as a defense or alongside a Parry, and pays the Activation Cost.

			<p>An Overrun is a highly specialized and demanding Maneuver, similar in concept to a Master-Strike, but it is 
			more limited than the latter. It combines a defense and an attack in the same action, in the same Exchange, 
			and involves evading an opponent’s blow while at the same time launching an attack of your own.</p>
			
			<p>After paying the Activation Cost for the Maneuver, the Player assigns dice to its defensive and offensive 
			actions. The defensive action is an Evasion, rolled against a Target Number of eight (8) like a Partial 
			Evasion. Any additional Activation Cost from Encumbrance, if these optional rules are being used, must be 
			paid as well, <em>out of the dice assigned to the defense.</em></p>
			
			<p>If the Evasion is successful (Quality of Success of zero or greater), the dice assigned to the offensive 
			part of the Overrun are now used to launch an immediate Bash, Cut, or Thrust against the opponent. Any 
			Activation Cost for this Offensive Maneuver, including Reach penalties, must be paid as well, <em>out of the 
			dice assigned to the offense.</em> Any positive Quality of Success from the Evasion carries over into the 
			offensive part of the Maneuver as bonus dice.</p>
			
			<p>If the Evasion is unsuccessful, the offensive part of the Overrun goes ahead anyway, but any damage is 
			determined before the Overrunning Character’s attack roll, and its consequences are applied in full, 
			including Shock penalties and any possible Knockdown.</p>
			
			<p>A combatant carrying out a successful Overrun as her defence may assume the role of aggressor, unless the 
			attacker inflicted a higher wound level on the Overrunner than the Overrunner inflicted on the Attacker, in 
			which case the attacker remains the aggressor. Overrun leaves the combatants at the engagement range of the 
			Reach of the weapon of the combatant who emerges as the aggressor.</p>

			<p><strong>* Sword & Shield: Lower of the two given Activation Costs is for use without a shield.</strong></p>
			
			<p>This Maneuver is the basis for all non-shield, non-dodging defenses. It consists primarily of using one’s 
			own weapon to deflect - not halt - an incoming attack. Parries are performed by simply rolling defense with 
			the Defence Target Number of the weapon at hand as the normal Opposed check of a combat Exchange.</p>
			
			<p>If a combatant is wielding two weapons, one in each hand, this Maneuver allows him to deflect two attacks, 
			one with each weapon. To do so, he assigns dice from his Melee Pool in any proportion to either Parry. Remember 
			that actions with a weapon in the off hand are at +1 Target Number.</p>

			<p>Characters using this maneuver can attack with a Cut, Bash, or Parry <strong>with any weapon of Medium Reach 
			or shorter</strong>. Because the curvature of a weapon makes this Maneuver easier, straight-bladed or 
			hafted weapons of Medium or longer Reach require an additional 1 Melee Pool over the normal Activation Cost. 
			Weapons with a Reach of Hand and Short need no such curvature, and can be quick-drawn with no penalty.</p>
			
			<p>Weapons of Long Reach and shorter can also benefit from this Maneuver by making a sudden thrusting attack 
			with the pommel or butt end of the weapon. This has no additional cost, but its statistics differ than the 
			parent weapons: the attack has a Reach of Hand, and is a Thrust Attack with a Target Number of six (6), 
			and a Damage Rating of –1 Blunt.</p>
			
			<p>In all cases, the weapon being quick-drawn is assumed to be at the hip or in some other very accessible 
			place.  For those weapons carried in less accessible places - such as a boot knife or short weapon over the 
			shoulder - add 1 Melee Pool die to the Activation Cost (compounding with any other penalties or modifiers). 
			Weapons in packs or other immediately inaccessible places are just that: inaccessible.</p>
			
			<p>To perform this Maneuver in play simply declare which weapon is being quick-drawn at the beginning of any 
			Exchange (usually the first, but not necessarily), and state whether it is being used to Cut, Bash, or Parry. 
			After spending the Activation Cost and allowing for any penalties, a Terrain Check is made against the weapons 
			normal Attack Target Number -1 (if the drawing hand is free) or Attack Target Number -2 (if the drawing hand 
			is on the weapon’s grip already).  If this Terrain Check is successful, the Parry goes forward normally, using 
			defense rules. If this Terrain Check fails, the character is forced to use some form of Evasion or get hit. 
			The weapon will be free for the next Exchange.</p>
			
			<p>This Maneuver can be combined with the rules for initiative and stealing it. Likewise, don’t forget to use 
			Reach rules here, including those rules for getting inside of a weapon’s Reach, or this Maneuver will lose 
			much of its bite.</p>

			<p>The Rota is a riposte maneuver. The back edge of the blade is used to deflect an opposing attack, after 
			which an immediate cut with the forward edge is performed. The weapon is not moved far, and as such, the 
			location of the counter attack is fixed. <strong>This maneuver is only available against swinging (Cleaving 
			or Blunt) attacks</strong>, and the counter attack must be a Cleaving or blunt swinging attack, not a 
			thrust.</p>
			
			<p>The Rota is similar to the Counter Maneuver with the same benefit for success (the attacker’s successes as 
			bonus dice for the counter attack the following exchange). However, instead of the random location of the 
			counter attack, the Rota counter attacks the same Target Zone on the opponent that he originally targeted on 
			the character.</p>

			<p>Winding & Binding is a deadly game that results when two weapons clash and stick together for a time. While 
			declared as a standard Parry, the Activation Cost of both Maneuvers must be paid. If the Parry fails, the 
			defender is struck as normal. However, if it is successful, the Winding & Binding comes into play, with an 
			opponent’s weapon not deflected, but instead collected on the defender’s sword, both weapons sticking 
			together.</p>
			
			<p>Even if the defender merely ties the attacker, the initiative passes to him and he receives the Quality of 
			Success of his Winding & Binding defence as bonus dice for his counterattack from the bind in the subsequent 
			Exchange. The nature of this follow-up attack, which has no Activation Cost, is somewhat random. It is the 
			result of the shoving and winding match of the two combatants locked together, each trying to either disengage 
			or strike past his foe’s defending weapon.</p>
			
			<p>While a Thrust past an opponent’s guard is the most likely outcome, it is by no means the only one possible. 
			To determine the actual form of the follow-up attack, the initiator of the Winding & Binding roll a d6 on
			the following table.</p>

			bonus dice for the current aggressor, any or all of which may also be used as a + / - modifier for the d6 roll 
			on the above table.</strong></p>
			
			<p>Winding & Binding changes the engagement range. All attacks from the above table happen at optimum Reach 
			for the attacker, this now being the new engagement range.</p>
			
			<p>The defender has the choice of three defenses against the Winding & Binding attack determined on the 
			above table:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>If she knows the Winding & Binding Maneuver herself, she may declare it alongside a standard Parry, 
				paying the Activation Cost for both. If she at least ties his opponent, the bind is maintained, but she 
				becomes the new aggressor, carrying her Quality of Success in the defence over as bonus dice into her 
				follow-up attack, as determined by her roll.</li>
				
				<li>SHe may try to disengage her weapon. This is handled as a normal Parry with an additional Activation 
				Cost of +1. In addition, initiative only switches to the defender if she is successful by a Quality of 
				Success of at least three (3).</li>
				
				<li>She may try to run off completely. This is handled as an Evasion with an additional Activation Cost 
				of +3. On the first Exchange of the Winding & Binding, only Partial Evasion is possible, as the 
				defender was attacking on the previous Exchange. Should the Winding & Binding continue into a second 
				Exchange, the defender may now also try a Full Evasion, which – if successful - ends the bout as usual.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>No matter how the Winding & Binding ultimately ends, the loser is now at an optimum engagement range for 
			the combatant who emerges from Winding & Binding as the aggressor, provided the bout is not broken up by a 
			successful Full Evasion.</p>
