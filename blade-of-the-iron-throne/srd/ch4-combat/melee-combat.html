			<p class="h2">Melee Combat</p>
			<p>The world of <em>Blade</em> is a dangerous one. Though fierce monsters and abominations inhabit the far 
			corners of the world, adventurers must also be on the lookout for thugs, cutpurses, assassins, mercenaries, 
			and anybody else who would kill them for their silver. But the most deadly foes care nothing for treasure, 
			and instead want a hero’s corpse for darker purposes...</p>

			<p class="h4">Melee Combat Overview</p>
			<p>As Characters adventure throughout the world, they will encounter those who stand in their way. 
			Unfortunately, not all villains will launch themselves at the Characters with sword in hand. The more 
			dangerous ones use their snake tongues, devious minds, or sorcery to bring the heroes to ruin. Game Masters 
			will throw all types of foes against the Characters – those who fight with tooth and claw, cowards who would 
			sooner run than battle, and those who seek to undermine adventurers with a labyrinth of plans and 
			deception.</p>
			
			<p>Sometimes, battle is inevitable. Though the warriors of <em>Blade</em> are well trained and deadly, even the 
			most inexperienced knave can thrust a pitchfork into the throat of a battle-hardened king. Players should keep 
			in mind that more people walk into battle than away from it...</p>
			
			<hr/>
		
			<p class="h4" id="P_CombatOrder">The Order of a Combat Round</p>
			<p>A Combat Round is fought in the following sequence:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>All stances are declared</li>
				<li>Aggressor and defender is established. Melee Pools fills or refreshes, with all Modifiers.</li>
				<li>During the first half of the Combat Round - the first Exchange - the aggressor attacks and defender 
				defends</li>
				<li>Damage is resolved and new attitudes can be determined (aggressor or defender)</li>
				<li>During the second half of the Combat Round - the second Exchange - the aggressor attacks and defender 
				defends. <em>These roles may have been reversed since the first Exchange</em></li>
				<li>All damage is resolved and new attitudes can be determined (aggressor or defender)</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>Steps two through six continue to repeat until the resolution of the combat or until the flow of combat is 
			interrupted. At the beginning of each new melee conflict (or following a pause) begin at step one, and then 
			repeat two through six as normal.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4">Steps One & Two: Stances, Initiative, and Surprise</p>
			<p>Unless taken by surprise, combatants will usually have time and opportunity to declare a stance – these 
			should be clearly announced at the table. Stances provide for a stronger attack or defence, but may add 
			rigidity to a combatant’s action.</p>
			
			<p>Though every school speaks with confidence on the superiority of its teaching, three stances are universal; 
			Aggressive, Defensive, and Neutral stances.</p>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Stance_Aggressive">Aggressive Stance</p>
			<p>Aggressive stances provide an attack bonus at the cost of making one’s defense more difficult. Assuming 
			them adds two Melee Pool dice for an attack, but increases Activation Costs for Defensive Maneuvers by two 
			Melee Pool dice.</p>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Stance_Defensive">Defensive Stance</p>
			<p>Defensive stances grant a defensive bonus, while making attack more difficult. Such stances add two Melee 
			Pool dice when Defending, but increase the activation costs for any Offensive Maneuver by two dice.</p>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Stance_Neutral">Neutral Stance</p>
			<p>Neutral stances are the favorite of many. In a Neutral stance, one’s weapon is positioned to allow for quick 
			attacks or defensive responses. Neutral stances provide no bonus to either attack or defense.</p>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p><em>Note: Stances are only in effect until the first blow or movement — once a Character’s weapon moves, the 
			stance is gone. Once melee is joined the stances of both attacker and defender are treated as Neutral, with 
			no bonus conveyed to either. A stance cannot be taken (or regained) until the combatants separate for a full 
			pause.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Initiative">Initiative</p>
			<p>Initiative is determined after stances are declared, when each combatant announces their intent to either 
			attack or defend. The intent of the combatants will usually be very clear from the circumstances under which 
			they enter combat – more often than not, one or even both will charge the other. Apart from counting as an 
			Aggressive stance, such a charge automatically suggests the intent to attack, leaving the other party to decide 
			whether to receive the charge, or to attack as well.</p>
			
			<p>Some rare combat encounters, for example formal duels or gladiatorial bouts, might start out less clearly, 
			with both combatants gauging each other, shifting from stance to stance, and waiting for an opening. In these 
			cases, it is advisable to demand that both parties declare their intent to attack or defend simultaneously, 
			maybe by lifting one finger for attack and two for defence. Until at least one party declares an attack, the 
			bout does not actually commence.</p>
			
			<p>If a party fails to declare intent while the other declares an attack, then this Character is considered to 
			have hesitated, and may only defend for one full Combat Round – if even that (see Surprise, below).</p>
			
			<p>The attacker, now having the initiative, declares how many dice from his Melee Pool are being spent on the 
			attack, where the attack is aimed, and what Maneuver, if any, is being used.</p>
			
			<p>In response, the defender declares how many dice from his Melee Pool are going towards defense, what defense 
			is being used, and what Maneuver, if any, is being executed.</p>
			
			<p>If both combatants declare as aggressors, Offensive Maneuvers and assigned dice are announced before the 
			Reflex Check to see who goes fractionally first. The combatant with the higher Reflex may choose whether to 
			declare first or second; tied Reflex scores are broken by the higher Cunning score, and tied Cunning scores by 
			the higher Proficiency.</p>
			
			<p>An Opposed Reflex Check (with the combatants’ own Attack Target Number for Target Numbers) determines whose 
			strike lands first. <strong>For every step of Reach difference of the weapons used, the wielder of the longer 
			weapon receives one bonus dice to this Check, and the wielder of the shorter weapon is penalized by one 
			die.</strong> In the rare cases where the combat begins at the optimum engagement range of the shorter Reach 
			weapon, these modifiers are reversed.</p>
			
			<p>Note that no defense is possible in the middle of an attack, so the loser of this Check will likely be 
			killed. In the Exchange that follows, the winner of this Exchange now assumes the role of aggressor and his 
			opponent that of defender. Should the Opposed Reflex Check be tied, both combatants strike at exactly the same 
			time.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_StealInitiative">Stealing Initiative</p>
			<p>Stealing Initiative is only possible immediately before the first blows of any bout are traded, and is 
			usually done in one of two circumstances: The first is when two combatants declare as aggressors and attack 
			simultaneously. If one combatant turns out to be fractionally slower than the other, he may attempt to Steal 
			Initiative. If both combatants attack at exactly the same time, the combatant with the higher Reflex score can 
			try to Steal Initiative; tied Reflex scores are broken by the higher Cunning score, and tied Cunning scores by 
			the higher Proficiency. Should she decline to try to Steal Initiative, the other combatant may try to steal 
			it.</p>
			
			<p>The party attempting to Steal Initiative pays an Activation Cost equal to half his opponent’s Sagacity 
			(0.50 rounds up). The attempt is an Opposed Check between the initiator’s Cunning and his opponent’s Daring.</p>
			
			<p>This contest is modified by differences in the Reach of the weapons used; if there is any difference, the 
			wielder of the longer weapon receives a flat +1 die bonus on his Check while the wielder of the shorter weapon 
			must incur a flat -1 die penalty. When the combatants begin the bout already at the Reach of the shorter of 
			the weapons involved, these modifiers are reversed.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, the initiator of the attempt, and only he, may buy bonus dice for his Check by spending dice from 
			his Melee Pool on a one-to-one basis, up to the value of his Daring. Passion Attributes do not modify to this 
			check, as Passion Attributes are already added to one’s Melee Pool at the beginning of the combat scene, and 
			are already accounted for.</p>
			
			<p>The winner of the Opposed Check strikes first, and the loser, should he still be able to continue after his 
			opponent’s attack, second. In a tie, the combatants strike simultaneously, which might leave both of them dead. 
			In any case, a combatant who had the Initiative stolen may immediately try to steal it back. Such attempts to 
			Steal Initiative or steal it back may theoretically continue until one party depletes his entire Melee Pool.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Surprise">Surprise</p>
			<p>Surprise can occur at any time, even when you suspect that danger is near. When a Surprise Check is called 
			for, the Player checks Reflex against a Target Number of seven, with the difficulty based on how alert the 
			Character or NPC was. The following table, Surprise Challenge Levels, provides some guidelines for this. 
			Failure indicates no action can be taken until the next Combat Round.</p>
			
			<p>Meeting the required number of Successes means that the target may defend themselves (or attempt to Steal 
			Initiative).</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_TheExchange">Steps Three & Five: The Exchange</p>
			<p>Each Combat Round consists of two Exchanges. During an Exchange, each participant may perform one action, 
			usually attacking or defending by using an Offensive or Defensive Maneuver.</p>
			
			<p>The aggressor may utilize both Offensive and Defensive Maneuvers. The defender can only use Defensive 
			Maneuvers, but may choose to execute an Offensive Maneuver if she pays a special Activation Cost (see below).</p>
			
			<p>All attacks must be aimed at a specific location, numbered from one to fourteen on the Target Zone diagrams. 
			Arrows indicate swing Target Zones while circles mark Target Zones for thrusting or missile attacks. While a 
			Player need not declare a specific number, she must describe the attack in terms that can be easily understood, 
			(ex, Thrust to the face, Slash to the right foot, etc.). Random attacks are not part of <em>Blade</em> melee 
			combat. Maneuvers and chosen Target Zones may increase or decrease the Target Numbers for the attacker and 
			defender, and may also require an additional Activation Cost. <em>Optionally, all melee thrusts to head and 
			limbs (Target Zones eight, nine, thirteen, and fourteen) may require an additional one-point Activation Cost to 
			execute.</em></p>
			
			<p>Both participants now roll the allotted Dice from their Melee Pool (See Step two), with all modifiers totaled 
			from all Maneuvers, stances, or other situations. This is a normal Opposed Check, where one party’s successes 
			are subtracted from the other’s, leaving the winner with a net Quality of Success. An attack causes damage only 
			if the attacker achieves a Quality of Success of one or more. Ties in the Opposed Check means no damage was 
			inflicted.</p>
			
			<p>All Target Numbers for this Check come from the Attack Target Number or Defense Target Number listed with 
			each weapon (see the Appendix) or defence. After all damage is resolved, a winning aggressor maintains his role 
			as the aggressor unless he declines it or cannot continue to fight because of a depleted Melee Pool while his 
			opponent still retains uncommitted Melee Pool dice. If either is the case, the defender may choose to take 
			on the role of aggressor.</p>
			
			<p>With a successful net Quality of Success, the defender may now take on the role of aggressor, unless she 
			tied the aggressor, in which case the latter retains their role.</p>
			
			<p><em>Note that some Defensive Maneuvers may (on a case-by-case basis) allow a successful defender to either 
			assume the role of aggressor on a tie, on paying an additional Activation Cost, or perhaps under no 
			circumstances at all. Any such special mechanics are explained within their respective Maneuvers.</em></p>
			
			<p>Finally, should a defender enter an Exchange and wish to execute an Offensive Maneuver, he may declare an 
			Offensive Maneuver like the aggressor, announcing both his Maneuver for the Exchange and the number of dice 
			allocated to it. This declaration of an Offensive Maneuver carries an Activation Cost equal to <strong>half the 
			aggressor’s Daring</strong> (0.50 rounds up, as always) above and beyond any normal Activation Cost for the 
			Offensive Maneuver.</p>
			
			<p>In such circumstances, the aggressor resolves his Maneuver first. Sneaking in an attack does not in itself 
			turn the previous defender into the aggressor; she still begins the next Exchange as the defender and her 
			opponent the aggressor. However, should the defender manage to inflict a higher Wound Level on the aggressor 
			than she received herself, she steals the role of aggressor from her opponent.</p>
			
			<p>Visibility has a profound effect on combat. In dim lighting (for example, dusk) deduct one die from all Melee 
			Pools. During hours of darkness (moonlight) reduce all Melee Pools to ¾. In pitch black conditions drop all 
			Melee Pools to half value. Archery Pools are affected twice as severely as Melee Pools, losing two dice from 
			all Archery Pools for dim lighting, and operating at half value for darkness. In pitch black conditions, all 
			Archery Pools are at 0.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Damage">Steps 4 & 6: Damage</p>
			<p>Should an attacker have one or more Success over his opponent then the attack has landed (see Steps three & 
			five). A d6 is rolled to determine the specific location within the Target Zone. Normally, a lower roll means a 
			lower hit on the body, and a higher roll a strikes higher. A Character can exert some control over where this 
			blow lands by paying an <em>additional activation cost before launching his attack</em>. Spending one 
			additional die from his Melee Pool allows him to modify the d6 roll for the exact hit location within the 
			Target Zone by +/–1; an additional two dice (for a total of three) purchases a modifier of up to +/– 2, and 
			further 3 dice (for a total of 6 dice spent) achieves a modifier of up to +/– 3.</p>
			
			<p><em>Note that a Player need not use his full modifier, but may use it in part or none at all. Damage is 
			calculated by adding the Quality of Success from the attack roll to the Damage Rating of the weapon 
			used.</em></p>
			
			<p>The Damage Ratings for the various types of attacks possible with a weapon are found in the Weapon Tables 
			in the Appendix, and will often fall in a range of –2 to +3. <strong>To this value, half the attacker’s Brawn 
			(rounded up for .50 or higher) is added</strong>. This represents muscle power put behind the attack, the 
			overall toughness and muscle mass protecting the body from serious injury (with a bit of good fortune), and 
			creates an Impact Rating. From this Impact Rating, <strong>half the defender’s Brawn (again, .50 or higher 
			rounds up) is subtracted</strong>, representing a mixture of grit, health, and muscle mass protecting the 
			vitals.</p>
			
			<p>Last, if the defender is wearing armour at the location hit, its Armour Value is subtracted from the Impact 
			Rating to arrive at a final damage number. This damage number is the Wound Level. For every wound’s location 
			and severity, there is a corresponding entry rendering a few words describing the wound, accompanied by several 
			numeric values in the Appendix.</p>
			
			<p>Wound Levels are rated from one to six. A level one wound is usually a bruise, scratch or minor cut with no 
			adverse effects. Wounds of level two and three are worse, but not debilitating, while a level four wound is 
			a serious matter that will, more likely than not, decide the fight against the wounded person.</p>
			
			<p>While level four wounds are debilitating, those of level five and six are lethal, either immediately because 
			of massive bleeding, or eventually fatal.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Limelights">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho’s weapon has a Damage Rating of two, and the wound that Otho inflicted 
				on Galb has a sub-total (or Impact Rating) of eleven. Rolling the location on a d6, we reference a direct 
				hit by Otho to Galb’s unprotected neck!</p>
				
				<p>Having no armour at this location, Galb may only subtract half his Brawn (5) from the Impact Rating... 
				11 - 3 (2.5 rounded up) = 8. This value of eight defaults down to a level six wound, a Wound Level which 
				indicates the complete decapitation of Galb’s head!</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>Location always makes a difference with wounds – a stab to an off-hand will be much less damaging than the 
			same level stab wound to the belly, and a well-placed cut to the throat can be deadly at even low Wound Levels. 
			Wound Levels are not cumulative, even from multiple wounds to the exact same location. Each wound and all 
			consequences from the wound description are recorded separately, and while the consequences of wounds may 
			add up (see below), many small wounds do not combine into one larger wound. To kill somebody, a solid injury 
			is needed, not a lot of minor ones.</p>
			
			<p>Of course, a number of minor wounds may well – and often will – accumulate and handicap a fighter so that 
			his enemy is likely to drive home that one telling hit needed to dispatch him. Barring more esoteric forms of 
			damage such as sorcery, the most common are listed <a href="Damage Types">here</a>.</p>
