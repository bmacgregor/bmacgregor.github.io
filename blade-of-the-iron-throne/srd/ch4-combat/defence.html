			<p class="h4">Defence</p>
			<p>Defence focuses squarely on a warrior’s efforts to avoid being struck by an opponent.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Evasion">Evasion</p>
			<p>Evasion can be done by anyone and used with every Proficiency. It doesn’t carry any Activation Cost, 
			unless the Character is encumbered and the optional Encumbrance rules are being used. In that case, there is 
			an Activation Cost; it can be found on the Encumbrance Terrain Modifier table.</p>
			
			<p>The table below provides Target Numbers for the three common forms of evasion:</p>
			
			<p class="h4">Evasion Target Numbers</p>
			<table class="table table-striped table-hover" id="TBL_EvasionTNs">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Five</td>
						<td>Full Evasion</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Eight</td>
						<td>Partial Evasion</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Ten</td>
						<td>Duck and Weave</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_EVA_FullEvasion">Full Evasion</p>
			<p>Full Evasion - if successful - brings all melee to a halt as the fighters separate and possibly attempt to 
			re-establish initiative. The bout ends for the moment, and stances can once again be assumed. If a Character 
			conducts a Full Evasion during an Exchange, the Quality of Success is added as bonus dice.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_EVA_PartialEvasion">Partial Evasion</p>
			<p>Partial Evasion - if successful - does not allow the defender to assume the role of aggressor as usual. No 
			matter what the actual Quality of Success of the successful Partial Evasion, assuming the role of aggressor 
			requires the immediate expenditure of 2 Melee Pool points. If the successful defender is unable (or unwilling) 
			to spend those dice, the aggressor retains his role.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_EVA_DuckNWeave">Duck & Weave</p>
			<p>Duck and Weave - if successful - gives the evading warrior a great opportunity to strike her opponent. She 
			automatically assumes the role of aggressor (even if her Quality of Success was merely zero) and moves into the 
			optimum range for her weapon’s Reach. Her opponent may <em>not</em> employ a shield against her follow-up 
			attack on the next Exchange, and loses dice from her Melee Pool equal to the Successes on the attack roll Duck 
			and Weave defended against. Should this penalty take the Melee Pool into the negative range, those dice are 
			added as bonus dice to the other party’s Melee Pool.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_EVA_EvadingMissileAtks">Evading Missile Attacks</p>
			<p>Evasion can also be used to defend against missile attacks, provided the defender is aware of them. The 
			Target Number for this is 8 (Partial Evasion) for thrown weapons, and 10 (Duck & Weave) for arrows, crossbow 
			bolts, and bullets.</p>
			
			<p>If the defender is aware that a gun, bow, or crossbow is being aimed at him, and has the opportunity to 
			start evasive movement before the missile is fired, the Evasion Target Number is now merely 8 (Partial 
			Evasion). This represents weaving around in a highly unpredictable way. If the Character is engaged in a bout 
			of melee combat, his unpredictable combat moves automatically count as this type of weaving movement, allowing 
			him to use the Partial Evasion Target Number against a missile attack.</p>
			
			<p>Evading missile attacks as outlined above is also possible when a Character is not in a melee situation. 
			In this case, she may use dice equal to half her best Melee Pool rating, even if she may not currently have the 
			equipment necessary for fighting with that Proficiency at hand. Applicable Passion Attributes figure normally 
			in this halved Melee Pool rating (they are added before dividing the pool in two).</p>
			
			<p>When a Character uses either Partial Evasion or Duck & Weave as a defence against a melee or a missile 
			attack, the result of this single defence roll is applied against all missile attacks aimed at him during this 
			Exchange. Equally, if a Character not currently in a melee is fired upon <strong>and</strong> uses Partial 
			Evasion to defend against a missile attack, the result of this single roll is applied against all missile 
			attacks on him within this Combat Round. Should he be targeted by both thrown and launched weapons which 
			require different Target Numbers to defend against (8 and 10), a single roll is still used to defend against all 
			of the attacks, but this roll will still cover the two different Quality of Successes required; one against the 
			Target Number of 8 and one against the Target Number of 10.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_RangedEvasion">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho evades both a javelin and a crossbow. He is not aware of the 
				crossbow, so his Defence Target Number against the javelin is 8 and against the crossbow bolt 10... His 
				Melee Pool is 13, but as he isn't in a melee, he rolls half his of his Melee Pool (7 dice). The dice come 
				up 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 – he has 3 Successes against the javelin (8, 10, 12) and 2 against the 
				crossbow (10, 12).</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<p>If somebody fires into a melee combat, the missile attack is always resolved on Exchange 1.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_DefensiveActions">Defensive Actions</p>
			<p>The bedrock of all Defensive Maneuvers discussed is the Block, the Parry, and Evasion. Most defensive 
			Maneuvers are directly tied to these basics. <strong>Parrying</strong> is the preferred defence of warriors 
			everywhere. Most warriors grasp the idea of turning the attack of an opponent’s weapon with their own. Any 
			amount of Melee Pool dice may be devoted to parrying while defending. The challenge of deflecting another’s 
			weapon is reflected by the defending weapon’s Defence Target Number (DTN).</p>
			
			<p>Some weapon schools, for instance those of the Cut & Thrust Proficiency, teach using a secondary parrying 
			weapon, usually a dagger, in the off-hand, allowing the person to potentially parry twice in a single Exchange, 
			or to perform Maneuvers like Simultaneous Block/Strike. Although parrying does not involve great manual 
			dexterity, a person’s secondary arm is still handicapped. <strong>The Defence Target Number of any parry 
			conducted with the off-hand is therefore increased by one</strong>.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Blocking">Blocking</p>
			<p>Blocking is the action of interposing an object, usually a shield, between oneself and the attack, perhaps 
			in a rather unsophisticated way, but also by skilfully angling a shield or using it offensively to beat 
			aside an attacking weapon. In this use, it is similar to the parry. Every blocking object is assigned a Target 
			Number for defending with it, this Target Number being dependent on the size of the object, and how quickly and 
			gracefully it can be moved. It is thus almost identical to a weapon’s Defence Target Number, but with one 
			important difference: Shields (and only shields, not improvised blocking objects like chairs and the like) are 
			designed to be used in the off-hand, and therefore suffer no penalty for being used with the wrong hand.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Shields">Shields</p>
			<p>Shields are divided into three types, depending on size: large, small, and bucklers. A large shield is just 
			that – a very large shield, measuring over one meter in length if an oblong shape, or having a diameter of not 
			much less than one meter if more squarish or round. It offers superior protection but is unwieldy to carry 
			about and very awkward to use on horseback as one’s horse constantly gets in the way of the shield. On the 
			positive side, most large shields are big enough to completely hunker down behind, removing its owner, 
			provided he remains static, from the danger of missile attacks.</p>
			
			<p>A small shield is anything larger than a buckler and smaller than a large shield. It is versatile, and of 
			equal use on foot or horseback.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, a buckler is a small, agile shield. It isn't strapped to the arm, but instead, carried in a 
			fist-grip. It's rarely any larger than 0.3 meters in diameter. All types of shields have variable Defence 
			Target Numbers against different forms of attack such as melee, missile attacks with thrown weapons such as 
			javelins or hatchets, or against fired projectiles like arrows, crossbow bolts, and sling stones – though fired 
			objects are often so fast (causing the defender to roll vs. a high Defence Target Number) as to often rule out 
			blocking as a viable defence against fired missiles.</p>
			
			<p>The applicable Defensive Target Number depends on both the type of shield, and the attack being resisted. 
			See the table, below:</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_ArmourOverview">Armour Overview</p>
			<p>The function of armour is to reduce or prevent injury to someone being hit in armoured spot. It does so by 
			reducing the Wound Level of any hit to an armoured location by the Armour Value (AV) of that armour. If the 
			Wound Level is reduced to zero or less, no wound is inflicted. Armour in <em>Blade</em> doesn't apply to all 
			locations of the armoured person, but to each location only to the extent that armour is worn in the spot being 
			struck.</p>
			
			<p>Someone wearing a short tunic of sturdy leather and an iron helmet will have a different Armour Value to the 
			crown of her head than to her guts or shins. Because of this, it is essential to record which spot is armoured, 
			and to what degree. The <em>Blade</em> Character sheet provides space for such notation. Armour doesn’t provide 
			the same Armour Value against all types of damage; a thickly padded gambeson provides decent protection against 
			Blunt damage, but much less so against Piercing. Each armour type has three Armour Values; one against 
			Piercing, one against Blunt, and one against Cleaving. These Armour Values can be found in the table below.</p>
			
			<p>Not all armours have an Armour Value against Cleaving damage. Metal armours are virtually impossible to cut 
			through with any weapon driven by human strength; the most that can be achieved is a dent or a small rip, a far 
			cry from a serious wound. This doesn’t mean that the wearer of such armour is immune against Cleaving weapons – 
			even if a blade does not actually cut through the armour, the impact will still transfer Blunt trauma, possibly 
			breaking bones, or perhaps even killing the wearer, all without seriously damaging the armour.</p>
			
			<p>For this reason, all weapon stats in the Appendix include Blunt Damage Ratings. Armour lacking a Cleaving 
			Value uses the Blunt Armour Value against Cleaving attacks, while attacking weapons calculate damage inflicted 
			against such armour use their Blunt Damage Ratings.</p>

			<p><strong>* Requires the wearing of a gambeson to be functional. If such armour is worn without a gambeson, 
			all Armour Values are halved.</p>
			<p>** Use the lesser value if suits of articulated plate are not available, otherwise, use the greater value for

			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3">3. Armour Types</p>
			<p class="h4" id="P_ARM_Gambeson">Gambeson</p>
			<p>Pliable textile armour made of a number of layers of quilted cloth and stuffed with cotton, animal hair or 
			other padding. Many other types of armour require the wearing of a gambeson underneath to function properly, 
			which is why the gambeson is also called an arming doublet.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ARM_Leather">Leather</p>
			<p>Tough, yet pliable, cured hide.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ARM_LeatherWMetal">Leather with Metal</p>
			<p>Pliable leather with short metal strips or rings sewn in strategic places to guard against cuts.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ARM_HardenedLeather">Hardened Leather</p>
			<p>Cured hide boiled and then dried to make it harder at the cost of most of its pliability. It can be 
			fashioned into segments large enough to serve as helmets and greaves, but not for workable breastplates.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ARM_LeatherHornScaleLamellar">Leather / Horn Scale / Lamellar</p>
			<p>Armour fashioned from strips of either hardened leather or animal bone. For scale armour, the strips are sewn 
			onto a backing of soft leather or heavy canvas, and then overlapped like roofing tiles. For lamellar armour, 
			each strip has holes fashioned into its edges and are then bound together and overlapped by two neighbouring 
			pieces while yet again overlapping others. Lamellar is therefore quite rigid, while scale is minimally 
			pliable. Still, neither can be used to protect a joint, and both require the wearing of a gambeson 
			underneath.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ARM_Brigandine">Brigandine</p>
			<p>Armour made of palm- to hand-sized metal plates, each sandwiched between two layers of heavy canvas or 
			soft leather and riveted together to stay in place, also known as Coat of Plates. Brigandine is quite rigid 
			and cannot be used to protect joints. It requires wearing of a gambeson underneath. Brigandine Armour Values 
			can also be used for Imperial Roman legionaries’ segmented armour.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ARM_Maille">Maille</p>
			<p>Also known as chainmail, this armour consists of a mesh of small metal rings, each interlinked with 
			neighbouring rings. It is supremely pliable and can therefore be used to protect joints, but it, too, is 
			dependent on a gambeson being worn underneath.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ARM_BrigandineOverMaille">Brigandine over Maille</p>
			<p>A special blend of layering armours, this was common during the transitional period from maille to plate, 
			and consists of maille with additional brigandine worn over it to protect the torso from shoulder to hip.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ARM_Plate">Plate</p>
			<p>Metal plates shaped to encase the body, including helmets. Plate armour requires the wearing of a gambeson, 
			which along with an articulated suit of plate may also have insets of maille.</p>
