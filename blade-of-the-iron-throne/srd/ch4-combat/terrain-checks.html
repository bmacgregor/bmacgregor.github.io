			<p class="h2">Terrain Checks</p>
			<p>Terrain Checks in <em>Blade</em> take place within the abstracted combat environment. During a melee, it is 
			not only common but actually necessary that combatants twist and turn about, advance and step back. Once a 
			combat begins, all fighters will by default move significantly from the spot they occupied at its outset.</p>
			
			<p>Even a single Combat Round might easily shift the combatants as much as five meters in an unforeseen 
			direction, and frequently more; that’s the nature of footwork. Once a combat with multiple fighters has been 
			underway for even one Round, it is nigh impossible to determine where anyone is in respect to anyone else – 
			except as it relates to one’s own immediate opponents.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="container text-justify">
		<div class="panel-body">
			<p>Their own footwork, the press of enemies, and wheeling maneuvers will have carried every pair of fighters 
			in a largely random direction; allies who started out fighting side by side will by find themselves separated 
			quickly. In short, as long as a Limelight is underway, it is impossible to tell where anyone is in respect to 
			anyone else.</p>
			
			<p>Locations are roughly re-established once a Limelight ends, and with certainty when a Round of Limelights 
			completes. Positions are determined by the Game Master's common sense based on what has happened during the 
			previous Round of Limelights. As a Player vividly describes his combat actions, the GM is encouraged to take 
			notes and visualize the Character's end location within the combat environment. It can happen that a Player 
			finds his Character in a location where he doesn’t want him to be, which is only a concern if the Character is 
			desperately needed elsewhere.</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_EngagingDistantFoes">Engaging a Distant Foe</p>
			<p>If the Character wants to engage somebody who is quite a distance away, or get to any other location in the 
			combat environment, this is handled by a Terrain Check.</p>
			
			<p>A Terrain Check is made with dice from the Character’s Melee Pool – any number of dice, Player’s choice. The 
			Game Master sets the Difficulty of the Check by how far and over what terrain the Character will have to move, 
			but it will rarely, if ever, be greater than a Difficult Challenge Rating (three successes). If the optional 
			Encumbrance rules are being used, every Terrain Check other than one for bad footing or refusing to be 
			dislodged from a fixed location carries an Activation Cost that can be found in the Encumbrance Terrain 
			Modifier table. If several such Terrain Checks should be made during the same Combat Round, this Activation 
			Cost must be paid separately for every Check.</p>
			
			<p>If the Check is passed, the Character arrives at the point she wanted to reach in time, whatever that may 
			mean (usually to engage somebody in melee with the dice remaining in her Melee Pool), and if not, she arrives 
			there late.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Terrain">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho has just spent a point of Drama to come to Rufo's aid. The GM tells 
				Otho’s Player that two Successes on a Terrain Check are necessary to get to Rufo’s side before he is struck 
				down.</p>
				
				<p>Playing it safe, Otho’s Player opts to spend six dice, and achieves three Successes. Rushing at Rufo’s 
				enemy, Otho attacks with the remaining dice in his Melee Pool, just in time to save his companion.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<p>Failing this kind of Terrain Check should rarely, if at all, be interpreted as the Player having wasted his 
			Limelight on a failed attempt. Instead, the Game Master should give him something else to do or a new, 
			unexpected challenge. A failure might be interpreted as the Character being intercepted by a new enemy, if 
			applicable. The use of Terrain Checks are not limited to simply getting somewhere on time. A Terrain Check may 
			also be needed to navigate an area with poor footing.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_TypesOfFooting">Types of Footing</p>
			<p>Normal footing like broken ground, light snow, mud, or deep sand do not necessitate a Check, but truly 
			poor areas such as steep, slippery slopes, scree fields, stairs, narrow ledges, ice, deep snow, or water and 
			the like do. If all combatants of a particular Melee are on this kind of difficult ground, 2 dice are 
			deducted from everyone’s Melee Pool, and the need for a Check simply done away with. If only one combatant is 
			on poor ground however, a Terrain Check must be made for that Character.</p>
			
			<p>If she achieves even a single Success with the dice she sets aside for this purpose, she can act and move 
			normally, but if not, she slips, stumbles, or falls down. Because of this, it's advantageous to fight on level 
			ground while forcing one’s opponent into a position of poor footing. Provided there is poor ground nearby, 
			Terrain Checks can also be used to force an opponent onto bad footing, and keep her there, or to get out 
			of it oneself. Such attempts are handled through an Opposed Terrain Check. The initiator of the attempt 
			announces a number of dice from her Melee Pool to be used, after which her opponent sets aside a number of dice 
			from her Melee Pool as well, then both roll. To win the contest, the initiator needs a Quality of Success of 
			one if she is currently the aggressor, or two if the defender – it is easier to force somebody somewhere than 
			to lure them.</p>
			
			<p>This can even be used to force someone over a nearby drop, but only if initiated by the aggressor. As 
			people are remarkably reluctant to fall from heights, success on such an attempt requires a Quality of Success 
			of at least three, provided that the drop is of a kind likely to injure the falling person. In many cases, 
			someone on bad footing facing an enemy on level ground need not force his opponent back so that he can 
			get firm footing himself, but may well opt to simply step back up a pace or two, enticing the opponent to 
			follow him onto the disadvantageous ground and thus evening the odds. This only needs to be announced, and 
			requires a normal Terrain Check to avoid slipping on the poor surface; no opposed roll is needed. If the 
			opponent declines to follow, the bout ends. However, it is not always feasible to entice the opponent to 
			follow; sometimes one will want to, and have to, fight one’s way onto the opponent’s better ground.</p>
			
			<p>If the opponent is holding the head of a stairway or the top of a steep slope against all comers, no normal 
			amount of enticement will force her down to her opponent. While these cases assume at least some room for 
			lateral movement on the holding Character’s part, there may be other scenarios, where she cannot move anywhere 
			at all, such as when defending a doorway. While such positions are advantageous in terms of limiting the number 
			of possible attackers, they interdict footwork and can cramp combat performance.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_HoldingGround">Holding Ground</p>
			<p>An attempt to remain firmly in one spot requires one Success on a Terrain Check, if unopposed. If an 
			enemy is actively trying to dislodge one from a position he is holding, the Terrain Check becomes Opposed. 
			The initiator of the attempt, who must be the current aggressor, declares the number of dice committed, after 
			which his enemy does the same, and then both of them roll. To dislodge the holding person, a victory with a 
			Quality of Success of one or greater is needed; ties signify that the holding opponent remains in place.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_HigherGround">Higher Ground</p>
			<p>Higher footing (as provided by stairs or horses) adds two dice to the Melee Pool at the beginning of the 
			Round (Step 2). This also affects attack zone targeting for all involved combatants according to common 
			sense.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_AvoidingOpponents">Avoiding Opponents</p>
			
			<p>Finally, Terrain Checks can be used by a Player with multiple opponents to avoid facing several at once. By 
			moving so that his opponents foul each other’s attacks and by exploiting the environment, the combatant tries 
			to limit the number of opponents he fights this Combat Round. If these opponents are important NPCs, the 
			Terrain Check is an Opposed one.</p>
			
			
			<p>The Player declares which opponent he wants to avoid. This opponent announces a number of dice from his 
			Melee Pool to oppose the Characters attempt to avoid him, and the Player then sets aside a number of dice from 
			his Melee Pool himself. An Opposed Check using these dice is then made. A Quality of Success of zero allows the 
			Player to attain his objective, provided that the Character wasn’t engaged with the opponent in the previous 
			Combat Round. A Quality of Success of one is required to avoid an opponent with whom he was previously 
			engaged.</p>
			
			<p>This means of breaking off a combat bout can only be used if facing multiple opponents at once, as it 
			represents moving in a manner that has one opponent getting in the other’s way. If facing only one opponent, 
			a bout can only be broken off after a successful Full Evasion, or if both combatants decline to attack. If 
			the first opponent is thus avoided, the next opponent is treated in the same fashion. A number of dice 
			from both Melee Pools are again set aside and an Opposed Check made. The Quality of Success of the previous 
			Opposed Terrain Check for avoiding the first opponent is added as bonus dice to this second Check. There are no 
			additional Checks needed, as it is <strong>physically impossible for more than three opponents to attack the 
			same person at one time</strong>.</p>
			
			<p>If the enemies aren’t important NPCs, the Terrain Check is unopposed. If the Character is trying to avoid 
			one of her two opponents, she needs a Quality of Success of one. If she is facing three opponents, a Quality of 
			Success of three is required to avoid two opponents, while a Quality of Success of two avoids one. At the very 
			outset of the battle, the required Quality of Success for avoiding one or two out of three opponents are 
			reduced by one, provided the Character is not surrounded by his opponents. A Quality of Success of two avoids 
			two out of three opponents, and a Quality of Success of one avoids one out of the three. As soon as the 
			Character becomes engaged in combat with any of her opponents, this reduced Quality of Success to avoid 
			opponents no longer applies, nor does it apply if the Character started out surrounded, or in a comparably 
			disadvantageous position.</p>
			
			<p>Please note that a Character may use a Terrain Check to move into positions where the number of opponents 
			who can engage him at once is limited, for example with his back against a wall. In such an instance, a 
			maximum of only two - not three - opponents can attempt to engage the Character at the same time. There are a 
			few further uses for Terrain Checks, which are discussed in the section on ranged combat.</p>
