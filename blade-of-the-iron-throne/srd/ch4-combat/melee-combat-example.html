			<p>As the Picts rush Skold, the Game Master informs the Player that the combat will take place on particularly 
			bad footing – the wet rocks of the beach – necessitating a deduction of 2 dice from all combatants’ Melee 
			Pools, bringing them down to 17 and 8 respectively. At the outset of Combat Round One, the GM declares that the 
			Picts’ charge puts them into an aggressive stance and that Skold, seeing them rush at him, has time to prepare 
			himself and declare a stance as well. Wanting to finish this combat before more Picts can arrive, the Player has 
			Skold assume an aggressive stance as well, and announces that Skold is going to move in such a way that one 
			Pict is between himself and the other, preventing the second Pict from attacking him right away. This 
			necessitates an (Unopposed) Terrain Check, with a single Success required. The Player commits 5 dice (taking 
			his Melee Pool to 12) and rolls, achieving 4 Successes (1, 10, 10, 11, 11), easily avoiding the second Pict 
			amongst the rocks and boulders.</p>
			
			<p>The Pict’s intention to attack is apparent from his ferocious charge, and the Player declares Skold as 
			attacker as well. As both combatants have assumed aggressive stances, their Melee Pools receive 2 bonus dice 
			each, totalling 14 and 10 respectively.</p>
			
			<p>With both combatants attacking, an Opposed Reflex Check will determine who attacks fractionally first, with 
			Maneuvers and dice assigned before this Check. The Player announces a Cleave from above at the Pict’s head and 
			shoulders (Target Zone 4) for 11 dice, executed at Long Reach. The Game Master declares a Thrust at the groin 
			(Target Zone 10) for all the Pict’s 10 dice.</p>
			
			<p>Both combatants’ Reflex is then Checked, with a Target Number equal to their weapon’s Attack Target Number; 
			as the Pict’s spear is Medium Reach and Skold axe has a Long Reach, Skold receives a +1 die bonus and the Pict 
			a corresponding -1 die penalty. Skold rolls 7 dice (Reflex 6 +1) against a Target Number of 8, and achieves 1 
			Success (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, and 9). The Pict rolls 4 dice (Reflex 5 –1) against a Target Number of 8, and 
			achieves 4 Successes (8, 11, 12, 12) – the Pict goes first!</p>
			
			<p>The Player, however, has an ace up his sleeve and Skold attempts to Steal the Initiative. He pays the 
			Activation Cost of 2 dice (half opponent’s Sagacity), and decides to play it safe, purchasing 1 bonus die for 
			the Check, for a total Activation Cost of 3 dice. This uses up the uncommitted remainder of his Melee Pool. The 
			Pict checks his Daring with a flat penalty of 1 for having the weapon with shorter Reach, and Skold checks 
			Cunning with a flat bonus of 1 for having the weapon with the longer Reach (and the 1 purchased bonus die).</p>
			
			<p>Skold rolls 7 dice (Cunning 5 +1 for reach and +1 bonus die) against a static Target Number of 7, and 
			achieves 3 Successes (2, 2, 5, 5, 8, 9, 11). The Pict rolls 4 dice (Daring 5 –1 for reach) against a static 
			Target Number of 7, achieving 2 Successes (3, 4, 10, 11) – just as the Pict thrusts with his spear, Skold’s axe 
			comes down hard. Skold attacks with the Melee Pool dice previously committed, rolling 11 dice against an Attack 
			Target Number of 8 and achieves 5 Successes (1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 11, 12). The Pict cannot defend, so 
			the attack Quality of Success is 5. The Player rolls a d6 on the Cleaving Damage Tables to determine the exact 
			hit location, and gets a 3, resulting in a cross-cut across the Pict’s chest, which is protected by his leather 
			jerkin.</p>
			
			<p>The Impact Rating is determined by then taking the Quality of Success (5), adding half ok Skold's Brawn (4), 
			and adding the weapon's Damage Rating (3, +1 for striking armor), for a total of 13. From this Impact Rating, 
			half the Pict’s Brawn (3) and  his chest Armour Value (2) get subtracted, for a remaining total of 8, 
			which rounds down to the maximum Wound Level of 6. As the Pict is just a mook, the Level 6 injury kills him 
			instantly, without any need to consult the Wound Tables.</p>
			
			<p>As Skold has neither Melee Pool dice nor a remaining opponent, there is no second Exchange to this Combat 
			Round, and the second Combat Round commences with the remaining Pict charging across the rocky beach. The Game 
			Master decrees that all fighters still have to deduct 2 dice from their Melee Pools for treacherous footing, 
			and that Skold can only just turn in time to receive the charging Pict, meaning he can't assume a stance. He 
			announces that the Pict’s charge puts him into aggressive stance. Combat Round two starts with the declaration 
			of attack or defence. The Pict is declared as aggressor, granting him 2 bonus dice from stance for a total 
			Melee Pool of 10, and Skold as defender with 17 Melee Pool dice at his disposal.</p>
			
			<p>Next, the aggressor declares Maneuver and assigns dice – he declares a Thrust with 7 dice at Skold’s crotch 
			(Target Zone 10). Smiling evilly, Skold’s player declares a Counter, paying the Activation Cost of 3 dice and 
			assigning 10 of his remaining 14 MP dice to it. The Pict rolls his assigned 7 dice against Attack Target Number 
			8, with a penalty of 1 for having a weapon one Reach increment shorter than Skold, for a total of 6 dice and 
			achieves 3 Successes (1, 4, 6, 9, 10, and 11). Skold’s Player rolls the assigned 10 dice against the axe’s 
			Defence Target Number of 8, as per the Counter rules, achieving 4 Successes (4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10). 
			With a defense Quality of Success of 1, a sweep of the axe knocks aside the thrusting spear harmlessly and the 
			attacker now on Exchange Two assumes the role of defender (with Counter, even a defence Quality of Success of 0 
			would allow him to do so).</p>
			
			<p>Exchange Two commences with Skold assuming the role of aggressor. The Pict has 3 remaining Melee Pool dice, 
			and Skold has 4, but as per the Counter rules, Skold receives dice equal to the total Successes in the 
			countered attack as bonus dice for his follow-up attack; the Pict previously achieved 3 Successes, so Skold 
			receives 3 bonus dice, bringing his Melee Pool to 7.</p>
			
			<p>The Exchange begins with the declaration of attack; the Player declares an attack with all 7 dice, randomly 
			as per the rules for the follow-up on a Counter. A d12 is rolled on the Counter Table to determine the nature 
			of Skold’s attack and yields a result of 2 - a cross-cut to the thigh. The Pict declares a Block with his 
			remaining 3 dice as his defence.</p>
			
			<p>The Player rolls the assigned 7 dice against Attack Target Number 8 and gets 4 Successes (2, 6, 7, 8, 8, 
			8, 11). The Pict rolls 3 dice against his shield’s Defence Target Number of 6, achieving 2 Successes (2, 8, 
			10), for an attack Quality of Success of 2. The Player rolls d6 on the Cleaving Tables to determine exact hit 
			location, and gets a 4 for a cut to the thigh, which is unarmored.</p>
			
			<p>The Impact Rating is determined by taking the attack Quality of Success (2), adding half Brawn (4) and 
			weapon Damage Rating (3), for a total of 9. Half the defender’s Brawn (3) is subtracted from this for a net 
			total of 6, once again enough to kill a mook like the Pict without the need to look up the injury on the Wound 
			Table.</p>
			
			<p>Two Picts charged Skold Skullsplitter. He wheeled, getting one between himself and the other. Skold then 
			brought his axe down a mere blink of an eye before his Pictish opponent’s spear thrust hit home, cleaving the 
			savage’s chest to the spine and knocking him to the ground dead. He then wheeled to receive the second Pict, 
			coolly swept aside his opponent’s spear thrust with his axe, and in the same fluid motion brought the weapon 
			around in a narrow arc, dipping under the shield’s rim to sever the Pict’s leg just below the crotch. With the 
			fallen Pict screaming on the ground and spurting out his life in but a few heartbeats, Skold leaves the scene 
			of carnage.</p>
