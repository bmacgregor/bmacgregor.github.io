			<p class="h2">Animals in Combat</p>
			<p>In <em>Blade</em>, animals of the wild are, after men, the second most common combat adversaries for the 
			Characters, and much more common opponents than monsters or supernatural beasts. Game Masters are advised to 
			somewhat ignore the actual behaviour of real-world animals.</p>
			
			<p>The latter have learned to fear man, and usually only attack under exceptional circumstances, and even then, 
			only as a last resort. The world of Sword & Sorcery (being the ferocious place that it is), makes it 
			appropriate to reduce this natural fear. Here, man might not be simply prey of the last resort for packs of 
			wolves, bears, tigers, and other predators, but may actually be well within their normal range of prey.</p>
			
			<p>While wild animals of the Sword & Sorcery genre are often more aggressive, they should not be portrayed as 
			universally rabid. In most cases, they don't fight to the death. A single level three wound should be enough to 
			drive off most animals, unless they are truly desperate, or cornered.</p>
		</div>

			<p class="h4">Animals in Combat Overview</p>
			<p>In targeting animals with attacks, the human Target Zone template will usually not be appropriate. In many 
			cases, common sense may better serve instead of a template – hits to birds and snakes can be allocated quite 
			easily. For quadrupeds of all sizes, a separate target location template is provided.</p>
			
			<p>No separate Wound Tables for animals are provided. Instead, just use the human ones and interpret the 
			results with a bit of common sense.</p>
			
			<p>Knockdown against quadrupeds is the one wound result that usually needs modification. As long as all four 
			legs of a quadruped are functioning properly (ex. no wound greater than level three to any leg), Knockdown 
			success requirements for any wound received is reduced by two.</p>
			
			<p>If one leg is already impaired, Knockdown is applied normally, and if two legs should already be impaired 
			and the animal is still aggressive, Knockdown success requirements are increased by two.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LargeAnimals">Large Animals and Wounds</p>
			<p>Wounds to animals are calculated exactly like wounds against humans, but for large animals that are much 
			more massive, this may yield odd results. For those animals, final Wound Levels suffered after subtraction of 
			half Brawn and Armour Values should be halved.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_LargeAnimals">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: The wound result of a large Grizzly bear’s level five wound would be 
				reduced to a level three wound (5 divided by 2 = 2.5 which then rounds up to 3). As a rule of the thumb, 
				this applies to wounds to the torso (not head and limbs) to all animals larger than a pony, and for all 
				wounds (including both head and limbs) to any animal the size of a rhinoceros or larger. As an optional 
				rule for those who want added realism (and added complication), all Piercing damage that would simply be 
				halved due to a target animal’s large size is increased by +1 before being halved.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_HugeAnimals">Huge Animals</p>
			<p>Even though such creatures are rarely encountered in Sword & Sorcery, some Game Masters might want to 
			utilize truly huge creatures as opponents for their Characters. A creature that is at the very least as big as 
			a rhinoceros may engage more than one Character at once, provided its build logically allows for this. A giant 
			octopus creature might, for example, engage several Characters simultaneously, as might a tyrannosaur, biting 
			one and kicking another opponent, but a giant wolf, lacking multiple modes of attack, might not. A creature 
			able to engage more than one Character at once can - within one and the same Round of Limelights - act in 
			more than one Character’s Limelight. During how many Characters’ Limelights it can act, and how many Characters 
			it could engage needs to be adjudicated by the Game Masters on the basis of the creature’s size and physical 
			shape.</p>
			
			<p>The creature need not split its Melee Pool between Limelights, but gets its full Melee Pool against every 
			Character. However, the Melee Pool is reduced by two dice for every Character after the first that the creature 
			engages. This penalty does not become bigger by two for every additional Character’s Limelight during which the 
			creature acts, but is applied to its Melee Pool across all Limelights equally.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_HugeAnimals">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho and Rufo are fighting a gargantuan crab-demon, huge enough to act in 
				both Limelights, attacking each of them with one of its pincers. The demon’s Melee Pool is 15, but this is 
				reduced by two for fighting a second Character, making its effective Melee Pool against both Otho and Rufo 
				a 13.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>If the discontinuity between a huge creatures’ various combats in any given Round of Limelights and the 
			lack of cooperation among its opponents worries a group, the following optional rule may be used:</p>
			
			<p>The huge creature’s Melee Pool for any given Limelight is penalized by the sum of the total Wound Levels it 
			has suffered previously during the same Round of Limelights. This is a slight violation of the basic principle 
			that the Limelights of any given Round of Limelights occur at the same time, but simulates how one Character’s 
			efforts in fighting a huge animal carry over to dramatically aid his comrades’ efforts. If this optional rule 
			is being used, the huge creature’s Melee Pool is not reduced by two dice per opponent after the first, but by 
			only one die per opponent.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_FightingAnimals">Fighting Animals</p>
			<p>Animals do not use the normal Offensive and Defensive Maneuvers of humans, but their own take on some of 
			them, or Maneuvers entirely exclusive to them. By and large, animals that enter combat at all fight very 
			aggressively, using the better part of their Melee Pool for offence. The single defensive action they have at 
			their disposal is Evasion, though they do tend to make liberal use of the Evasive Attack Offensive Maneuver.</p>
			
			<p class="h3">Animal Maneuvers</p>
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Bash">Bash</p>
			<p>Most kicks by hooved animals are handled by the Bash Maneuver, but it may also be used for powerful tail 
			swipes or, for example, a hit by an elephant’s trunk. The Bash may also be used by horned animals to butt 
			opponents with their horns, for either Blunt, or Piercing damage, depending on the beast in question.</p>
			
			<p>This type of attack carries an additional 1 Melee Pool point Activation Cost (ex. 1, or 2 in case of an 
			attack causing +1 damage). Note that the option of spending 1 Melee Pool point to increase the attack’s Damage 
			Rating by +1 is not available if the attack causes Piercing damage.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Bite">Bite</p>
			<p>A simple bite, with most damage being Cleaving. Metal armour offers very good protection against bites.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Claw">Claw</p>
			<p>A swipe with claws usually inflicts Blunt damage with some additional Blood Loss, but may - with some rare 
			animal’s long talons - inflict Cleaving damage instead. Metal armour protects very well against animal clawing 
			attacks.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Constricting">Constricting</p>
			<p>Some animals kill their prey through constricting them. Prime examples are the many forms of large snakes, 
			but this form of attack may, at the GM's discretion, also be available to bears, if she desires to include the 
			infamous bear hug attack in her game. To use the Constricting Maneuver, the beast must first have made a 
			successful grapple attack on an opponent, though a bite attack may be substituted for animals like snakes that 
			can establish the initial hold by biting.</p>
			
			<p>Once the hold is established by the use of the Grapple (or Bite) Maneuver, the animal may attack by use of a 
			Constricting Maneuver each Round, free of Activation Cost. Melee Pool dice are assigned for the attack, and the 
			constricted opponent assigns any number of Melee Pool dice for the defense (remember that a grappled opponent 
			must use his Wrestling Proficiency to calculate his Melee Pool). Both parties roll against a Target Number of 
			7.</p>
			
			<p>If the defender is victorious, he breaks free of the constriction and normal melee combat resumes at Reach 
			Hand, with the victorious defender now having initiative as aggressor. If the attacker ties or is victorious, 
			he inflicts Blunt damage on his opponent. The amount of damage inflicted is calculated without use of Quality 
			of Success or Armour Value, but by subtracting half the defender’s Brawn from half the attacker’s Brawn, with 
			a cumulative +1 added for every subsequent Round of constriction. The Wound Level inflicted may not surpass the 
			constrictor’s Quality of Success. The location of this Blunt damage depends on the circumstances. With snakes, 
			it will usually be to the lower abdomen or the legs, with a bear, a hug to the chest.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_EvasiveAttack">Evasive Attack</p>
			<p>This Offensive Maneuver is used quite extensively by animals. It functions exactly as for humans, (ex. the 
			animal spends the Activation Cost of 1 Melee Pool die, and additional dice as desired). The enemy’s Attack 
			Target Number is increased by the number of additional dice thus spent, whereas the animal’s own Attack Target 
			Number is only increased by half the number of the additional dice.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Grapple">Grapple</p>
			<p>Animals use the Grapple Offensive Maneuver, but what they do with a grappled opponent is different from 
			what humans may choose to do. A beast may not choose to immobilize a grappled opponent, but it may attempt to 
			throw her to the ground, or to break the grappled limb. In addition, certain types of animals have other options 
			as well: Snakes may attempt to crush the opponent to death, felines may rake her with their hind claws, and 
			canines may worry her with their powerful jaws. Details can be found under the respective Maneuvers.</p>
			
			<p>Beasts that can either use the Constricting, Raking, Pouncing, or Worrying Maneuver may use a successful 
			bite attack to enter a clinch. They can do this by attacking normally with the Bite Maneuver and simply 
			declaring after a successful hit, even one causing no wound, that they won’t let go. This immediately 
			establishes a clinch, though one in which the animal does not receive the establishing attack’s Quality of 
			Success as bonus dice on its subsequent Melee Pool, as would be the case with a clinch entered by use of the 
			Grapple Maneuver.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Pouncing">Pouncing</p>
			<p>Some animals such as tigers are proficient at surprising a victim by leaping upon them, using their 
			considerable mass coupled with speed of impact to stun their prey. This gives the Pouncing animal a decided 
			advantage in the Bite Maneuver that inevitably follows. All dice assigned to Pouncing are checked against a 
			Target Number of 7, and can be defended against by only by Evasion (the target probably has to first pass a 
			Surprise Check to be aware of the Pouncing animal and evade it).</p>
			
			<p>If the Pouncing attacker is victorious, it inflicts Blunt damage on its opponent. The amount of damage 
			inflicted is calculated without use of Quality of Success or Armour Value, but by subtracting half the 
			defender’s Brawn from half the attacker’s Brawn. Should the attacker be considerably heavier than the defender 
			(more than twice as heavy), +1 is added to this damage; if the attacker is considerably lighter (less than half 
			as massive), -1 is subtracted. The Wound Level inflicted may not surpass the Pouncing animal’s Quality of 
			Success.</p>
			
			<p>The location of this Blunt damage depends on the circumstances. With tigers for example, it will usually 
			be to the Shoulders, Chest, Ribs, or Abdominal areas. A successful Pounce attack also requires the opponent to 
			pass a Knockdown Check with a Challenge Level equal to the Pouncing attacker’s Quality of Success. If the 
			Pounce is successfully defended against (ex. evaded) in such a way that initiative passes to the defender, the 
			melee continues with Reach now set at Hand, and the defender as the new aggressor.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Raking">Raking</p>
			<p>Felines are especially fond of this Offensive Maneuver, one that can be considered an option of the Grapple 
			Maneuver available to them. Any time the animal is in a clinch with its opponent, whether this clinch was 
			established by use of the Grapple or the Bite Maneuver, it may pay an Activation Cost of 1 Melee Pool point and 
			attack with its hind claws. Such an attack does not in itself break the clinch.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Stampede">Stampede</p>
			<p>Certain animals (such as bulls) are able to attack opponents by charging and running over them. This 
			requires a run up and the expenditure of 1 Melee Pool die as an Activation Cost and can only be defended 
			against by Evasion. The attack is rolled against a Target Number of 7, and inflicts Blunt damage with a Damage 
			Rating of zero, or Damage Rating +1 if the beast has substantial horns. Knockdown from this attack is increased 
			by +1 to a minimum of 1, and the Check to avoid the Knockdown is made against (6 + the Quality of Success on 
			the attack roll). If the stampede is successfully defended against (ex. evaded) in such a way that initiative 
			passes to the defender, the follow-up attack of the new aggressor is made at +1 Attack Target Number. This is 
			due to the stampeding animal’s speed carrying it quickly out of range of any attack.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Swooping">Swooping</p>
			<p>Swooping is the favourite attack of birds and other, sometimes larger, airborne attackers. Essentially, 
			it’s a fly-by claw attack. To initiate the Maneuver, the avian aggressor announces a Swoop. Her opponent then 
			declares any number of dice from her Melee Pool to prolong the contact with the avian, who then sets aside a 
			number of dice from her Melee Pool in opposition. Those dice are rolled as an Opposed Terrain Check. If the 
			Swoop’s victim is victorious, the Combat Round has the usual two Exchanges. If the result is a tie or a victory 
			for the avian, it is limited to a single Exchange.</p>
			
			<p>Whether the avian is successful on Swooping or not, it now has initiative as aggressor at its optimum 
			engagement Reach. An opponent conscious of the attack may attempt to Steal Initiative or declare as aggressor 
			as well, in which case her attack will only be resolved after the Swooping attack and at the avian’s Reach.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_TakeDown">Take Down</p>
			<p>Some animals are especially adept at bringing an opponent down to their level, either by launching their 
			mass at him, by attacking his legs, or by cunningly unbalancing him. The dice assigned to the Take Down 
			Maneuver are checked against a Target Number of 7, and can be defended against by Blocking or Evasion, but not 
			by Parrying.</p>
			
			<p>A successful Take Down attack causes no damage, but requires the opponent to pass a Knockdown Check with a 
			Challenge Level equal to the Take Down’s Quality of Success. Animals that are used to working as a team, like 
			packs of canines, may combine forces to Take Down an opponent. Knockdown Checks must be made against every 
			individual Take Down, but for every previous Knockdown Check passed in one and the same Exchange, the Challenge 
			Level of the Knockdown Checks against Take Down is increased by one.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Worrying">Worrying</p>
			<p>Certain beasts, particularly canines and certain large felines, have extremely strong jaws. Once such an 
			animal has made a successful bite attack on an opponent, it may choose to hold on, thereby entering a clinch, 
			and to “Worry” the attack (meaning that it locks its teeth and shakes its head).</p>
			
			<p>On the exchange following a successful bite attack, the animal may assign any number of dice to the Worrying 
			Maneuver. The opponent may assign dice from his Melee Pool, but as he is now in a clinch, his Melee Pool is 
			based upon his Wrestling Proficiency. Should the bitten opponent wish to go on attacking the animal, he is 
			allowed to use his weapon Melee Pool instead, but in this case may not assign more dice to resisting the 
			Worrying than the value of his Reflex score (plus any Passion Attribute dice figuring in the Melee Pool).</p>
			
			<p>Both opponents roll against Target Numbers of 7. If the worrying animal is victorious, the wound inflicted 
			by the previous bite becomes aggravated by one Wound Level, with all attending penalties, including Pain, Blood 
			Loss, and Knockdown, but excluding Shock and Knockout. The animal may choose to hold on and continue with the 
			Worrying Maneuver, or it may let go. If the Check is tied, the wound does not worsen, but the animal may choose 
			to let go or hold on, as above.</p>
			
			<p>If the defender is victorious, he breaks free and the melee continues with Reach now set at Hand, and with 
			him as the new aggressor. The victim of a Worrying may attempt to attack the animal with the part of the Melee 
			Pool he does not set aside for resisting the Worrying, after the Worrying attack has been resolved. Such an 
			attack is made at Reach Hand and carries an additional Activation Cost equal to half the animal’s Quality of 
			Success on the Worrying Check, plus the usual Activation Cost for declaring an attack as defender (ex. half the 
			aggressor’s Daring score). If this Activation Cost reduces his Melee Pool to zero or below, he may not 
			attack.</p>
			
			<p>While holding on to the prey, the worrying animal can defend only by use of Duck & Weave. Whether it is hit 
			or not, the animal will retain initiative as aggressor and will not be forced to let go, though may of course 
			choose to do so. Apart from possibly killing the beast or wounding it seriously enough to drive it off, the use 
			of attacking and wounding a worrying beast lies in the dice it will lose from its Melee Pool for the next 
			Worrying attack.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_PackTactics">Pack Tactics</p>
			<p>Many animals naturally form communities. Strong ties are often formed, especially in the case of canines 
			(including wolves, hyenas, jackals and the like) and some wild cats (tigers and leopards, for instance). Such 
			animals are highly effective at working together to bring down foes. If a pack or team of animals is fought, 
			and the number of combatants on both sides are roughly equal, the combat is handled as usual, but if the 
			animals clearly outnumber their opponents, the rules below should be used. In such cases, predators, who are 
			cunning at evaluating prey will always concentrate their surplus number on the weakest victim, while more 
			dangerous ones will simply be kept in check by a single animal each.</p>
			
			<p>These single beasts will not expose themselves by fighting offensively, but will merely attempt to stall 
			their opponent until their comrades bring down the weaker prey.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_PACK_Baiting">Baiting</p>
			<p>This is a form of feint used by a group of animals working together closely. The beast using the Baiting 
			Maneuver pays an Activation Cost of one die, but declares another Offensive Maneuver. Once the defender has 
			assigned dice to the defence, the Baiting Maneuver is revealed for what it is. The baiting beast may now add 
			any number of dice to the attack, at an additional Activation Cost equal to half the number of dice added. 
			The initially declared Offensive Maneuver is then rolled and defended against as usual.</p>
			
			<p>If the defender wins the Opposed Check, she takes initiative as normal. If the aggressor ties or wins, no 
			damage is dealt, as the entire attack was only a ruse to draw out the defender. Instead, the defender loses 
			dice equal to the aggressor’s Quality of Success from her Melee Pool for either the following Exchange or the 
			following Round if the current Exchange was this Round’s last one.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_PACK_Swarming">Swarming</p>
			<p>Animals fighting in packs are extremely good at surrounding an opponent and attacking him from different 
			sides at the same time. Up to four medium sized animals (such as wolves) may attack an opponent, rather than 
			the usual limit of three.</p>
