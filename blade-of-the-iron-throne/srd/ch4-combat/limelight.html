			<p class="h2">Limelight and the Combat Round</p>
			<p>The basic temporal unit any Combat Scene in <em>Blade</em> is the Combat Round. During the Combat Round, 
			every combatant has dice to spend on actions equal to his Melee Pool. Players will have to be judicious about 
			what activities they spend their Melee Pool dice on, and all associated costs to their Melee Pool. A 
			subdivision of the Combat Round is the Exchange, with every Combat Round consisting of two.</p>
			
			<p>The Exchange is the shortest division of a Combat Scene, which can consist of any number of Combat Rounds, 
			each made up of a pair of Exchanges. In <em>Blade</em>, combat isn't handled by going around the table from 
			Player to Player in order every single Round, let alone Exchange. Instead, every Player goes through a number 
			of Rounds before it is the next Player’s turn. This collection of unbroken Combat Rounds is called the 
			<em>Limelight</em>.</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_Limelight">Limelight Overview</p>
			<p>Limelight harks back to the way swashbuckling fights were once portrayed in movies, when the camera focused 
			on one combatant and his enemies for an intense set of actions and then, at a suitably dramatic moment, cut 
			to another exciting moment within the scene. This cut to another moment, sometimes pulling the viewer back in 
			time if the scene’s new focus took place prior to the moment cut from. This tried and true dramatic way of 
			portraying fights is reborn in <em>Blade</em>.</p>
			
			<p>There are no firm rules as to how many Combat Rounds a Limelight has, only guidelines when to end it and 
			move to another Player’s Limelight. Generally speaking, a Limelight is terminated at the end of its first 
			Combat Round in which something significant happens. We call this a <strong>cliff-hanger</strong>. A 
			cliff-hanger can be a wound being inflicted, a combatant being killed, a weapon being lost or knocked away, 
			a change in how the fight is being waged (for instance, opponents switching from Melee combat to a grappling 
			match), or any other noticeable change in the flow of the fight. Once something like this happens, the Game 
			Master calls an end to one Limelight and switches to another Player’s Limelight.</p>
			
			<p>The order in which Players go through their Limelight’s is largely determined at the outset of the fight, 
			and then remains fixed, unless changed by Player action, which is described later in this section.</p>
			
			<p>Under some circumstances - for instance when one Character out of several is under surprise attack - it’s 
			obvious whose Limelight is handled first, but in most cases it isn’t. If circumstances don’t dictate the order 
			of Limelight’s, the GM taps Players in ascending order of their Character's Cunning; lower Cunning levels go 
			first and high Cunning levels go last, with ties broken by Reflex, or by the highest Melee Proficiency if 
			still tied. However, any Player whose Character’s Cunning is higher than the Cunning of the Character being 
			called up by the Game Master may opt to step in before the round begins and have her Character’s Limelight 
			resolved earlier. Because of this, Characters with high Cunning have control of the initial Limelight order.</p>
			
			<p>Once every Player at the table has had a Limelight (called a <em>Round</em> of Limelights) the order of 
			Limelights is established, and this order remains unchanged for the entire combat – unless a Player steps in to 
			change this sequence.</p>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p class="h4">A Word on Time</p>
			<p>Neither Exchanges nor Combat Rounds take a fixed amount of time. Depending on circumstances, a Round may 
			easily be as little as one second and as much as fifteen seconds, or even more; as long as a Character is going 
			through his Limelight, there is no telling how much time has actually passed. However, once a Round of 
			Limelights has been completed, time snaps back, and the Characters all realign to the same point in time. Thus, 
			the Player who - in his Limelight - played through five Combat Rounds is at the same point in time as the 
			Player who played through just two.</p>
			
			<p><em>At any time</em> between one Player’s Limelight completion but before the next Player’s Limelight 
			commences, <em>any Player who has not yet had her Limelight moment within the round</em> may step in and 
			Steal the Limelight, having her Limelight conducted immediately. Doing so requires the payment of one Drama 
			point, and the sole caution that the Player who Steals the Limelight must not yet have had her Limelight moment 
			during the current Round of Limelights.</p>
			
			<p>By Stealing the Limelight, the sequence of Limelights is changed – and remains changed. The Player who has 
			spent the Drama point has thereby elevated herself from her old place in the sequence to a new one, and the 
			order of Limelights created by this act becomes the new order of Limelights for the remainder of the combat – 
			or until someone else Steals the Limelight yet again. Stealing the Limelight can be advantageous in many 
			situations, and is often done to enable one Character to rush to the aid of another.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Limelights">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Three characters, Rufo, Karg, and Otho, are each fighting an enemy in 
				this order during the current round of Limelights. When the second Round of Limelights begins, all three 
				are engaged in melee combat. Having his Limelight first, Rufo is wounded, allowing the GM to cut to Karg’s 
				Limelight.</p>
				
				<p>Sometime into Karg’s Limelight, he and his opponent go from melee into a grappling ground fight, again 
				a useful juncture to cut to Otho, who during his Limelight dispatches his opponent and ends his 
				own Limelight. A new Round of Limelights begins, with Rufo going first – but as Rufo has just been wounded, 
				there is a danger of him being killed. Otho’s Player decides to spend a Drama point to Steal the Limelight. 
				Otho, now going first and being unengaged, has gained a chance to rush to Rufo’s side and save his 
				life.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>In quite a few fights, not all Characters will actually be Melee combatants, or combatants at all, and their 
			Limelights work a bit differently. While their place in the sequence of Limelights is determined normally, 
			instead of fighting, they use their Limelight to do one relevant thing - not <em>preparing</em> for something 
			relevant, but doing it, all the way. This relevant action could be a lot of things. Often, it will be firing a 
			missile (and yes, even cocking a heavy crossbow, loading and then discharging it are accomplished within the 
			space of a single Limelight) or casting a spell, but it might be picking a lock, breaking down a door, lighting 
			a fire, untethering the group’s horses – anything really.</p>
			
			<p>The sole constraint is that the action should be one that could conceivably be accomplished within the 
			space of thirty seconds. So, all sorcery and missile attacks work alike in melee situations. You can use your 
			pool, whether Archery or Sorcery Pool, once, <strong>and only once</strong> per Limelight. That said, there is 
			nothing to prevent a sorcerer from beginning a Limelight using his Melee Pool, and then switching over to a 
			sorcerous action and using his Sorcery Pool. This would be governed by exactly the same mechanics as someone 
			switching over from using his Melee Pool to using his Archery Pool. Note that he may do so only at the 
			beginning of a round’s second Exchange, with an upfront Activation Cost equaling the amount of Melee Pool 
			points spent by him during the first Exchange. This represents the rigors of invoking sorcery in the middle of 
			a hectic melee.</p>
			
			<p>NPCs, even the most important ones, do not have a Limelight of their own. An NPC’s opportunity to act 
			arrives when the Character with whom she is locked in some kind of struggle or other interaction has her own 
			Limelight. If this Character moves to a new place within the Order of Limelights, the NPC moves with hrt. In 
			those cases, where NPCs not currently in some form of contest with a Character try to accomplish something 
			entirely on their own and unopposed by a Character (e.g. breaking down a door), the Game Master should 
			adjudicate this action with common sense and announce its progress or completion as seems right.</p>
			
			<p>In those very rare cases when timing should be more important, such an NPC can be given a place within the 
			Order of Limelights of their own. However, this is only possible for as long as this NPC does not interact with 
			a Character; the moment they start interacting with a Character (ex. having broken down the door, the NPC 
			charges a Character), they loses their place within the Order of Limelights, and commence acting during the 
			Characters Limelight.</p>
			
			<p>All NPCs must be assigned to a given Character’s Limelight at the beginning of that Limelight, with all 
			Players being informed of any NPC attached to their Character’s Limelight, whether the Character would be aware 
			of the presence of the NPC or not. An NPC who was not assigned to a Character’s Limelight cannot interact with 
			that Character during this Limelight.</p>
			
			<p>In addition, an NPC can only be assigned to one Characters Limelight during any given Round of Limelights; 
			should she fail to act on this Limelight, she cannot be reassigned to another Limelight later taking place 
			during the current Round of Limelights.</p>
