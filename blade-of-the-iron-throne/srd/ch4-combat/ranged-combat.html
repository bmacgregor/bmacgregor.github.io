			<p class="h2">Ranged Combat Overview</p>
			<p>In <em>Blade</em>, ranged combat can include attacks from a thrown rock to a steel-pronged crossbow and 
			everything in between. Attacks may sometimes occur as a single, sniper-like shot with no chance for the target 
			to react, but more frequently the attack will be launched into a melee, or will perhaps lead to a melee 
			situation. Such attacks are rolled with dice from the Character’s Archery Pool, and consists of (Aim + Missile 
			Proficiency).</p>

			<p class="h4">Ranged Combat (Continued)</p>
			<p>For the latter case, ranged combat must be integrated with melee combat in order to give archers a place in 
			the Order of Limelights. This spot in the Limelight sequence is determined exactly as if the archer was a melee 
			combatant, with the same principles holding true for both participants.</p>
			
			<p>That is to say that sometimes, when it is clear who is going first (for example when an encounter is 
			initiated by a crossbow bolt from an ambush), the Game Master will establish the Order of Limelights by calling 
			Players in a logical order. However, in cases where the sequence is more random, Players will be called to play 
			out their Characters’ Limelights in ascending order of Cunning, as described in the section on Limelights and 
			the Combat Round.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_MakingAnAttack">Making a Ranged Attack</p>
			<p>During his Limelight, a Character intending to launch a missile attack can do so, provided he has the 
			weapon at hand. There is no preparation, loading, or aiming times, as a Limelight is considered a span of 
			time sufficient to accomplish a significant task, which includes firing a weapon, not merely preparing to fire 
			it. As melee combatants move about during their own Limelights, distances and line of sight usually won't be 
			apparent during the ranged combatant's Limelight. It's up to the Game Master to decide these things based upon 
			common sense, the Players’ description of their Characters’ actions, and the scene’s dramatic requirements.</p>
			
			<p>If the Player of a missile combatant is not happy with the GM's judgement, she can have her character move 
			into a more advantageous firing position. Such movement to get an unobstructed line of sight - or merely closer 
			to the target - is accomplished with a Terrain Check made with dice from the character’s Archery Pool. The Game 
			Master announces the Challenge Level to get to closer range or to achieve a free line of sight (rarely harder 
			than Difficult - two successes - if even that). The Player then attempts to pass the Check using dice out of 
			her Archery Pool, rolling any amount of dice desired.</p>
			
			<p>Success means that the Character achieves her objective, while failure signifies that she must either take 
			the shot at a longer range, or has to contend with cover obscuring the target, and occasionally, she might have 
			to deal with both circumstances (at a longer range <em>and</em> shooting past cover) – it never means that a 
			shot is outright impossible. A Terrain Check can also be used when a missile combatant is charged by an enemy 
			and must shoot her before being engaged in melee. In such cases, the Game Master decides the Challenge Level 
			based on how close the charging party currently is, and how ready the missile combatant is to fire.</p>
			
			<p>Casting a spear that is ready in hand before being engaged shouldn't be harder than Average (one success), 
			while spanning and discharging a heavy crossbow may be as difficult as Legendary (five successes), provided the 
			attacker isn’t very far off. If both opponents are important Characters or NPCs, the Terrain Check is an 
			Opposed one. The charging combatant declares how many dice out of his Melee Pool he is going to spend to engage 
			<em>before</em> he can be fired at, and then the missile combatant declares the number of dice from his Archery 
			Pool he is going to spend. Depending on the Game Master's appraisal of the situation (distance of the opponent 
			versus the readiness of the missile weapon), one opponent will likely need a Quality of Success of just one to 
			succeed, whereas the other may well need a higher Quality of Success.</p>
			
			<p>Whether the situation is handled by an Opposed Check or not, victory on the part of the missile combatant 
			will mean that he gets a shot off at practically point blank range. Failure, however, signifies that he will 
			be engaged before he can fire, and that the Combat Round immediately commences with the missile combatant’s 
			initial Melee Pool reduced by the number of dice the ranged Character spent from his Archery Pool on the 
			Terrain Check.</p>
			
			<p>If he was trying to throw a spear or similar weapon useful in close combat, he may opt to retain it in his 
			hand, combat-ready. Otherwise, he is assumed to have realized that his attempt to shoot his opponent would not 
			pan out, has dropped his missile weapon, and barely managed to whip out a melee weapon – if he has one.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_RangeIncrements">Range Increments</p>
			<p>Range, like many aspects of <em>Blade</em> combat, is handled in an abstract way. First and foremost, it 
			depends on the principle that the ultimate limitation to all range is human vision - it doesn’t matter that a 
			heavy crossbow can launch a bolt over 300 yards if one can’t discern the target at such a distant range. Even 
			missile weapons with theoretical maximum ranges as long as some bows and crossbows have realistic 
			<em>practical</em> ranges that are only a fraction of that maximum. Extreme ranges are for wide-shooting 
			contests and battlefield area-fire, not for taking down individual targets.</p>
			
			<p>Practical ranges vary from two to one-hundred meters, and are divided into Range Bands from Point Blank to 
			Extreme. The actual distance each Range Band covers is different for each type of ranged weapon. Weapons that 
			are thrown in such a way that they tumble while in the air (knives and hatchets) have the least range, while 
			those that are cast to fly straight (spears and javelins) can achieve a middling range, and finally those that 
			are launched (arrows, bolts and sling stones) travel the furthest.</p>
			
			<p>Each Range Band determines how easy or difficult it is to aim for a specific body part by governing how 
			many dice from the Archery Pool must be spent for a single +/- 1 modifier on the following Table. The Target 
			Zone of a ranged attack is determined randomly by rolling 2d6 on the Ranged Attack Zones table. That said, a 
			missile combatant has some degree of control over the exact Target Zone, and can spend dice from her Archery 
			Pool before rolling the attack.</p>
			
			<p>The number of dice needed to be spent for a single +/- 1 move on the Ranged Attack Zones table is listed in 
			each range band found in the following table (Range Band Modifiers). Also note that at Point Blank range, the 
			missile combatant receives a free modifier of +/- 2; if your target is right in front of you, you're not likely 
			to aim either high or low. Apart from this free +/- 2, the cost for further modifiers is the same as Near 
			range. This modifier does not have to be spent in full on the Ranged Attack Zones table; it can also be spent 
			in part or not at all, depending on the Player’s wishes.</p>

			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Cover">Cover</p>
			<p>Cover can complicate a ranged attack. While some obstacles can be avoided by means of a Terrain Check, this 
			isn't possible in all cases – no maneuvering in the world will do away with the cover given by a breastwork to 
			defenders manning a wall. Soft cover that obstructs vision but doesn't completely block it, like foliage or a 
			moving crowd of people, imparts a negative modifier to the Archery Pool.</p>
			
			<p>Depending on the GM’s judgement of how obscured the target is by soft cover, this modifier can range from –1 
			to –3 per line on the Range Band Modifier table. The possible modifiers are therefore for example –1, 
			–2, or –3 at Point Blank range (line one on the Range Band Modifier table), and –3, –6, and –9 at Medium range. 
			It can range from a mild –1 for a target at Point Blank range past a single person moving through the line of 
			sight, to a whopping –15 for a target at Extreme range that is made almost invisible by the densest of 
			foliage.</p>
			
			<p>The rules for soft cover also apply if one wants to fire into an on-going melee and hit one combatant while 
			avoiding the other, a difficult feat due to the unpredictable movements of both. In this case, the minimum 
			penalty for soft cover (ex. –1 per line on the Range Band Modifier table, effectively –1 to –5) is used – and a 
			Botch on the attack roll usually means a hit on a person the missile combatant doesn't want to hit.</p>
			
			<p>If that happens, the attack roll is repeated. The original penalty dice for firing into a melee still apply 
			for this roll, but neither penalty dice for soft cover or any dice possibly set aside for buying modifiers 
			on the Ranged Attack Zones table do. Any such penalty dice on the original roll are added to the new attack 
			roll, and any hit resulting from this second roll applied to the new target. The exact attack location on the 
			new target is determined randomly on the Ranged Attack Zones table with no modifiers to this roll.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_RangedCombat">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho is throwing his dagger at Far range to aid his friend Galen in his 
				melee against two opponents. Otho has an Archery Pool of 13. Four dice are subtracted for firing into a 
				melee at Far range, and a further three dice for buying a +/– 1 modifier on the Ranged Attack Zones table. 
				Otho Botches the attack roll with his remaining six dice, and has to reroll his attack, now with Galen as 
				target. The four dice penalty for firing into a melee still applies, but the three dice traded in for a +/– 
				1 modifier don’t; his Archery Pool is therefore 10.</p>
				
				<p>Should the attack hit, the damage location will be determined randomly on the Ranged Attack Zones table, 
				without the +/– 1 modifier Otho had purchased for his original attack.</em></p>

			<p>Hard cover that cannot be fired through represents a more extreme problem for a missile combatant. If it 
			can’t be circumvented to get a clear shot, the attacker will just have to take his chances by investing heavily 
			into modifiers on the Ranged Attack Zones table and hope that this modifier is sufficient to hit a location 
			which isn't covered.</p>
			
			<p>Defending against missile attacks is only possible against attacks that one is aware of. It is preferably 
			done with a large shield, or alternatively by evading. Details on that process and its associated Target 
			Numbers can be found in the section on defending.</p>
