			<p class="h2">Mounted Combat Overview</p>
			<p>In <em>Blade</em>, the value of a mount extends far beyond being just a means of transportation. In a game 
			where bloody, brutal, and action-oriented combat is held in such high regard, it seemed only natural that 
			mounted combat should be exhilarating. Rider and mount are treated as a single entity for the purpose of 
			mounted combat. All combat actions, whether by the rider or by the mount, and whether Maneuvers or Terrain 
			Checks, are performed out of the rider’s Melee Pool, and the following rules apply while the character is 
			fighting mounted: If fighting opponents on the ground, the mounted character receives +2 dice to his Melee 
			Pool, as he is effectively attacking from higher ground.</p>

			<p class="h4">Mounted Combat Continued</p>
			<p>For as long as the mount is moving, the mounted combatant’s Riding Skill aids her in remaining the tactical 
			master of the combat situation. At the beginning of every Combat Round, the mounted combatant makes a Riding 
			Check, unaided by any Passion Attributes. The number of Successes on this Riding Check (or half their number if 
			a Daring Check is substituted for a Riding Check) become bonus dice to the mounted character’s Melee Pool for 
			this Combat Round, useable solely for Terrain Checks. An exception to this limitation are Full Evasions 
			and Bash or Stampede Maneuvers performed with the mount – the bonus dice from the Riding Skill Check can be 
			used for these.</p>
			
			<p>If the Riding Check comes up with no Successes, the character’s Melee Pool for the Combat Round is penalized 
			by one die. In addition, an immediate second Riding Check has to be made. If this Check again comes up with no 
			Successes, the character is thrown from their mount. If a group isn’t bothered by the absence of the likelihood 
			that a poor rider receives no benefit from being mounted and wants to speed up resolution, this Riding Check 
			can be waived and bonus dice equal to half the mounted character’s Riding Skill level awarded as a flat bonus 
			every Combat Round. In this case, low Riding Skill levels impart no benefit. Skill level one (or Daring one or 
			two in absence of the Skill) penalizes the Melee Pool by one die, Skill level two (or Daring three or four) adds 
			nothing, and Skill level three (or Daring five or six) imparts a one die bonus. Riding Skill levels of four or 
			greater impart the usual modifier of bonus dice equal to half the level.</p>
			
			<p>If the optional Encumbrance rules are being used, a mounted combatant must only pay the additional Evasion 
			Activation Cost from Encumbrance for Partial Evasion, and Duck and Weave. If he performs a Full Evasion, he 
			pays no additional Activation Cost, no matter what his or his mount’s Encumbrance. In addition, bonus Melee 
			Pool dice from the Riding Check at the outset of the Combat Round are usable on a Full Evasion roll. If a 
			mounted Character’s only Maneuvers for an entire Combat Round are Full Evasions, he may use his Riding Skill, 
			plus any bonus dice derived from the initial Riding Skill Check in lieu of a weapon Proficiency to calculate 
			his Melee Pool for the Combat Round.</p>
			
			<p>If the optional Fatigue rules are being used, a mounted combatant needs one Success less at the Brawn Check 
			to avoid Fatigue than suggested by her Encumbrance. In many cases, this will mean that the Brawn Check is an 
			automatic Success. The Character can, under certain circumstances, use her mount like a weapon. Only a 
			combat-trained mount can be made to kick at opponents on the ground, but nearly any mount can be forced to ride 
			down an opponent on the ground. To do so, the mounted Character can resort to the animal combat Maneuvers Bash 
			and Stampede, using her own Melee Pool for the attack, but her mount’s Brawn to determine any hits Impact 
			Rating. Bonus Melee Pool dice from the Riding Check can be used to deliver such attacks.</p>
			
			<p>If the Character during a Combat Round performs no other Maneuver but have his mount Bash or Stampede, he 
			may use his Riding Skill, plus any bonus dice derived from the initial Riding Skill Check, in lieu of a weapon 
			Proficiency to calculate his Melee Pool for the Round. If a Character performs both a Bash or Stampede with his 
			mount and any weapon-based Maneuver, the usual mechanic for switching Proficiencies during a single Combat 
			Round is used, treating Riding Skill plus bonus dice from the Skill Check like a Proficiency: The Melee Pool is 
			re-calculated based on the new Proficiency used. If the Melee Pool based on the new Proficiency is lower than 
			the original one, the current Melee Pool is immediately penalized by the difference in the pool sizes.</p>
			
			<p>A Bash with the mount can never be performed as a ride by attack, and a Stampede with the mount may only be 
			performed as a ride by attack (see below). Some common sense is required in adjudicating what Maneuvers are or 
			aren’t possible in mounted combat, with a few pointers being given here:</p>
			
			<p>Unless using weapons of at least very Long Reach, attacking Target Zones 1, 6, or 8 of an opponent on the 
			ground should be impossible for a mounted combatant, and carry an additional Activation Cost of 1 for even 
			these weapons.</p>
			
			<p>Attacking Target Zones 2 and 9 should be impossible with weapons of a Reach shorter than Long, and carry an 
			additional Activation Cost of 1 even for them. Some attacks can be declared outright impossible (ex. dagger 
			thrust at the groin). Conversely, a combatant on foot will not be able to attack a mounted opponent with 
			swings aimed at Target Zones 4 or 5, unless she is using a weapon of at least Long Reach and pays an additional 
			Activation Cost of 1.</p>
			
			<p>Thrusts at Zone 13 should require an additional Activation Cost of 2 for weapons with Reach Hand and of 1 
			for weapons with Short Reach, and thrusts at Zone 12 should require an additional Activation Cost of 1 for 
			weapons with Reach Hand. Some attacks can be declared outright impossible.</p>
			
			<p>If a combatant on the ground is being attacked with a ride by Stampede and also declares an attack as his 
			action for Exchange One, he may only target the mount, not the rider. If a mounted combatant performs an 
			Evasion, keep in mind that Full Evasion is always thought of as completely disengaging both mount and rider, 
			while both Duck and Weave and Partial Evasion can be thought of as being performed either by the rider alone, 
			without moving the mount much, or as being performed by moving the mount. Evasions performed by moving 
			the mount, no matter with which of the three evasive options, are also the only means by which attacks directed 
			against the mount can be defended against. Neither blocking nor parrying such attacks is possible.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_RideByAttacks">Ride-by Melee Attacks</p>
			<p>Canny horsemen will use their mount’s speed to quickly strike and swoop out again before their opponent 
			has a chance to retaliate. This requires that the mount be moving at least at a canter, preferably a gallop, 
			and is performed as a Terrain Check, unless the opponent who is about to be attacked while being ridden by 
			does not object to this; in this case, no Check is necessary and a one Exchange long combat is conducted, as 
			if the rider’s Terrain Check had been victorious. Against unimportant NPCs, this Check is an Unopposed one. 
			A single Success on the rider’s part will limit the Combat Round to a single Exchange as the mounted combatant 
			swoops past his opponent. If no Success is achieved, the Combat Round lasts the usual two Exchanges.</p>
			
			<p>Against a Character, the Terrain Check is an Opposed one. The party that is ridden by announces a number of 
			dice from her Melee Pool to prolong the contact with the mounted opponent, who then sets aside a number of 
			dice from her own Melee Pool in opposition. If the party wishing to prolong the contact is victorious, the 
			Combat Round has the usual two Exchanges. If the result is a tie or a victory for the mounted party, it is 
			limited to a single Exchange.</p>
			
			<p>No matter whether the Combat Round of the ride-by attack last for one or two Exchanges, the bout is over at 
			the end of the Combat Round as the mounted combatant rides away, possibly to turn around his mount for another 
			ride-by attack. If both combatants are mounted and either stationary or going in the same direction, a ride-by 
			attack is impossible, and a normal, multi-Round combat is conducted. If they are not going in the same 
			direction, it is automatically a ride-by attack of either one or two Exchanges depending on the outcome of the 
			Terrain Check, provided the Check is not forgone by both riders being equally desirous to limit their 
			contact.</p>
			
			<p>During the first Exchange of a ride-by attack, the combatant with the longer weapon performs his attack at 
			the optimum Reach for his weapon. If the combatant with the shorter weapon attacks as well, and happens to 
			attack fractionally before his opponent, either by winning the Opposed Reflex Check or by Stealing Initiative, 
			he attacks at the Reach of his opponent’s longer weapon, with all attendant penalties. Independently of this 
			attack hitting or not, the opponent with the longer weapon attacks at his own optimum Reach.</p>
			
			<p>If a second Exchange is being fought, this takes place at the optimum Reach for the weapon of the combatant 
			on foot, or at the Reach of the shorter weapon if both combatants happen to be mounted.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Jousting">Jousting</p>
			<p>The following mechanics are used to simulate a joust between two opponents who are both armed with lances. 
			If only one of the combatants is using a lance, normal mounted combat rules for ride-by attacks are used, of 
			course with the mount’s full Brawn being used instead to calculate the Impact Rating, as per the description of 
			the lance in the Appendix.</p>
			
			<p>A knightly joust, whether for sport or actual combat, is a ride-by attack un-resisted by both combatants 
			and handled in three stages: The charge is the usual Riding Check at the beginning of the Combat Round, but 
			this time performed as an Opposed Check. The Quality of Success is applied twice – once as an Melee Pool bonus 
			for the winner and once as an Melee Pool penalty for the loser. These dice become regular parts of the Melee 
			Pool, and can be used without restrictions.</p>
			
			<p>The clash sees each opponent declaring a Simultaneous Block/Strike and dividing his dice pool in any way 
			they choose between attack and defence. If the joust is for sport, no initiative is determined – both attacks 
			are thought to occur at the same time. If the joust is for combat, there are also no Reflex Checks made to 
			determine which attack occurs fractionally earlier, but Stealing Initiative is allowed. If nobody attempts to 
			Steal Initiative, both attacks occur simultaneously.</p>
			
			<p>The check occurs only in sporting jousts; in case of a combat joust, damage is determined as normal. For 
			formal jousts, with lances prepared to break, each opponent makes a Riding Check, with the Successes required 
			being equal to (3 – his Block Quality of Success). Failure means that the combatant is unhorsed. If one 
			combatant fails to block his opponent’s lance with his shield, he makes a Riding Check, requiring four 
			Successes, and suffers damage from the hit. With prepared jousting lances, the damage caused is <em>half</em> 
			of the mount’s Brawn +1 (Blunt) instead of the mount’s full Brawn +1 (Piercing).</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_MountedArchery">Mounted Archery</p>
			<p>Firing any type of missile, not just arrows, from a mount moving at speed is a tricky thing. Any Character 
			attempting to do so cannot use her Missile Proficiency at a rating higher than she has in the Riding Skill (a 
			theoretical maximum of nine). Should the Character lack formal training in the Riding Skill, her Proficiency is 
			instead capped at half of her Daring.</p>
			
			<p>Speeding chariots are a slightly more stable archery platform than galloping horses or similar riding 
			animals. The same rules apply as for firing missiles from horseback (using Charioteering instead of Riding, 
			of course), but the thresholds are increased by one point. Because of this, firing missiles from a chariot is 
			done at a Proficiency no higher than Charioteering +1, or (Daring / 2) +1 if the Skill is unknown.</p>
			
			<p>In any case, missile weapons that require both hands to use may never be fired by the driver of the chariot 
			himself, but only by a passenger. The passenger’s applicable Missile Proficiency is also limited exactly as 
			outlined above.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Barding">Barding</p>
			<p>Barding is armour for horses, granting them some measure of protection in battle. The <strong>criniere
			</strong> is a set of lamellar, scale, maille, or segmented plates that protects the horse’s neck. The 
			<strong>chanfron</strong> protects the horse’s face. It is made of plate, lamellar, or scale and often includes 
			cheek plates. The <strong>peytral</strong> hangs down from the Chanfron and protects the chest of the horse 
			down to the top of its front legs. It may be had in either leather (with or without metal reinforcement), 
			scale, lamellar, maille or plate.</p>
			
			<p>The <strong>croupiere</strong> protects the horse’s hind quarters. It can be made of leather (with or 
			without metal), scale, lamellar, maille, or plate. The <strong>saddle</strong> is what the rider sits on. 
			It has a high cantle and pommel to prevent the rider from being unseated, and is built on a wooden frame that 
			supports more weight from a rider with armor and weapons.</p>
			
			<p>Saddles are made of wood and many layers of thick and tough leather and protect part of the mounts back 
			like leather lamellar armor.</p>
			
			<p>The <strong>flanchard</strong> is attached to the side of the saddle, then around the front or rear of the 
			horse and back to the saddle again, protecting both sides and back of the mount. These are either metal plates 
			riveted to leather (protecting like brigandine), or else scale, lamellar, or maille. The use of such armour 
			requires that a saddle, croupiere and peytral also be used, as the flanchard needs to be attached to those 
			items.</p>
			
			<p>The <strong>cuissart</strong> and <strong>grevíere</strong> are greaves for the upper and lower legs of a 
			horse, respectively. They come in sets of four and must be carefully attached to the horse’s leg. Very thin 
			metal plating is used, and neither of the two guards the knee or hoof. The Armour Value provided by barding is 
			identical to the Armour Value of the corresponding armor pieces for humans, found in the Armour Value table in 
			the defence section of the rules. The sole exceptions are cuissarts and grevíeres, which protect with only 
			Armour Value 5 against Piercing and Armour Value 3 against Blunt damage.</p>
