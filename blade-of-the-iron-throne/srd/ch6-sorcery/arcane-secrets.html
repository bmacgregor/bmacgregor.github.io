			<p class="h2">Arcane Secrets</p>
			<p>The final layer of magic are the Arcane Secrets of ancient sages. Single, incredible acts of sorcery that 
			transcend the limits of any single Mystery. Arcane Secrets are just that – secret, only whispered in occult 
			circles; legends about what this or that famous sorcerer was able to accomplish. Not even the most powerful 
			sorcerer of yore knew all of them, and most legendary masters of eldritch power probably knew only a handful. 
			Still, such knowledge was enough to make them the stuff of legend.</p>
			
			<p>Because sorcery isn't science, Arcane Secret aren't researched, and new ones aren't be discovered, not even 
			if a thousand lifetimes were spent on this pursuit. Sorcerers who desire to learn one of these legendary acts 
			of sorcery must track down a source where it might be obtained. One possible source are powerful living 
			sorcerers, who might know a few of them – though getting them to impart this knowledge is a different matter 
			entirely...</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<!-- Jumbotron ends here -->
	
	<!-- Content begins here -->
	<div class="container text-justify">
		<div class="panel-body">
			<p class="h4">Arcane Secrets Overview</p>
			<p>Another source are demonic beings of immense power, which might be prevailed upon to share their knowledge – 
			or perhaps not. The innermost circles of some cults or secret societies (usually of the more unwholesome 
			variety) might also guard knowledge of one or two Arcane Secrets.</p>
			
			<p>Another source are the shades of dead sorcerers, rumoured to have possessed such knowledge, though their 
			deceased consciousness will often be too fractured to give anything more but telling hints – if they can be 
			summoned at all.</p>
			
			<p>The most uncommon sources are written ones, often found as inscriptions in some sanctum of an accursed 
			temple – sorcerers after all, are a jealous lot, and most who manage to track down a written source will 
			destroy it to prevent others from profiting from it. Needless to say, tracking down Arcane Secrets opens up an 
			avenue of adventure for sorcerer Characters.</p>
			
			<p>To learn any Arcane Secrets at all, a sorcerer must be proficient in <strong>at least one Greater 
			Mystery</strong>. There may well be other prerequisites, such as skill in a specific Greater or Lesser Mystery, 
			but practical knowledge of a Greater Mystery is <em>always</em> a prerequisite. The following is a selection of 
			Arcane Secrets to give Game Masters a feel for the scope of what they can accomplish. GM's are encouraged not 
			only to customise the names of these Arcane Secrets, but also to disallow any or all of them, and to create 
			additional ones, as fits their campaign.</p>
			
			<p>The total number of Arcane Secrets existing in any one setting is up to the Game Master, but anything under 
			five seems miserly, and anything greater than twenty is much too lavish.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Abomination">Abomination</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Mending</em></p>
			<p>This hours-long extended ritual must be conducted (with slight alterations) every week during about the 
			first third of a pregnancy over the body of a woman who is either a willing participant or  powerless to 
			resist. It changes the embryo into a monstrosity, whose eventual birth will almost certainly kill the 
			mother.</p>
			
			<p>When the abomination is born, the sorcerer Checks the worse of his Goety or Mending pool to determine how 
			much demonic energy he was able to infuse into the unborn, spending his Successes on this unopposed Check to 
			purchase changes in the infant. For every Success, he may either:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Increase human minimum, average and maximum value of one Attribute by +2</li>
				<li>Impart one useful feature like horns, fangs, poison, functional wings</li>
				<li>Grant the abomination up to 2 points of natural Armour</li>
				<li>Grant an Asset.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>By default, without spending any Successes, the abomination will always have –1 Sagacity, –1 Heart, and +2 
			Brawn, and it will always look decidedly inhuman and bestial. The actual looks depend on what essence the 
			sorcerer infused into the embryo; the abomination will always have clear visual traits of one species of animal 
			or legendary creature. In some settings, this Arcane Secret may be tied to imparting a specific essence, with 
			all abominations looking similar (for example, a setting-specific Abomination Arcane Secret may be called “Son 
			of the Bull” and always produce minotaur-like creatures).</p>
			
			<p>In any case, the abomination will grow into adulthood at about five-times the speed of a human, and it will 
			only be as loyal to its creator as the sorcerer is able to make it by any means at his disposal.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_AcolytesClaw">The Acolyte's Claw</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Mending</em></p>
			<p>This Arcane Secret is a supremely deadly martial art, harnessing the sorcerer’s eldritch power into smooth 
			movements and devastating blows. It is usable only for hand strikes and Maneuvers conducted with empty hands, 
			and for Evasion hand parries, which are possible without any chance of harm to the arm, even against weapons. 
			For all these actions, the Melee Pool consists of (Reflex + Brawling + Goety).</p>
			
			<p>Depending on the group’s preferences for the setting, the hand strikes take one the following two forms:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>The hand hits with Blunt Damage Rating +1, and causes additional Shock equal to the Wound Level</li>
				<li>The hand hits with Piercing Damage Rating -1 or Cleaving Swing Damage Rating 0, and all Armour Values 
					protect against it at only quarter value – the sorcerer practically reaches through the armour and into 
					the body</li>
			</ol>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_AnimateTheDead">Animate the Dead</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisite: Necromancy</em></p>
			<p>With this ritual lasting 30 minutes to an hour, the sorcerer can animate a dead body to a semblance of life 
			and create an undead. This Arcane Secret is intended to work on embalmed mummies and reasonably fresh corpses 
			still largely intact, but may also work on decomposed corpses. If this is the case, such animated skeletons do 
			not receive the +1 Brawn of other animated corpses (see below).</p>
			
			<p>To create a classic shambling corpse or skeleton: Such undead are almost mindless (equivalent to a Sagacity 
			of 1) and are devoid of memory and personality. They are, however, extremely loyal to their creator, whose 
			commands they are unable to resist.</p>
			
			<p>They have the same Attributes as when alive, but both their Heart and Tenacity are limited by their Sagacity 
			score, usually being 1. Animated dead receive –1 Move and +1 Brawn, and are completely immune to Blood Loss and 
			almost completely immune to Pain; instead of subtracting Tenacity from Pain, all their Pain is flat out reduced 
			by 10.</p>
			
			<p>To animate the corpse, the sorcerer’s Necromancy pool is checked. A single Success creates an undead, and the 
			sorcerer may spend her additional Successes to purchase:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Limited reasoning capacity for the undead – every Success spent grants +1 SY</li>
				<li>Great strength and ferocity – every Success spent grants +1 Brawn and +1 Proficiency</li>
				<li>Skill at arms – every Success spent grants 3 Proficiency points (maximum 9)</li>
				<li>Increased durability – every Success spent increases the life expectancy of the undead by a factor of 
					ten (base is one year)</li>
				<li>Multiple undead – a sorcerer can animate any number of corpses at once. She has to expend the Successes 
					for the most powerful or durable undead, with every additional undead requiring only 1 Success, even 
					though it may be of equal power as the first one. With 6 casting Successes, a sorcerer could animate 6 
					“basic” undead, or 5 undead with Brawn +1 and Proficiency +1 (2 Successes for first one and 1 Success 
					for every additional one)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>As long as the corpse is animated, it will not decay.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_BindTheSoul">Bind the Soul</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisite: Necromancy</em></p>
			<p>This Arcane Secret forces a dead person’s soul into a body, and evicting the owner’s soul. To conduct this 
			hour-long ritual, the sorcerer must first conjure a deceased person’s soul (described by the Necromancy 
			Mystery), but instead of questioning the soul, he anchors it in another body.</p>
			
			<p>During the ritual, the host must be conscious and either a willing participant (unlikely) or restrained. The 
			sorcerer makes a Casting Check with his Necromancy pool, which both the inserted soul and the host owner may 
			resist using Heart. If either the victim or the soul is victorious or ties the sorcerer, the sorcery fails and 
			the soul returns to whatever place it inhabits in the afterlife.</p>
			
			<p>However, if the sorcerer wins both Checks, the host body’s soul is driven out and passes into the afterlife, 
			as if the body had died. The inserted soul now inhabits the body until the body dies and the soul returns, once 
			again, to the afterlife.</p>
			
			<p>If a sorcerer also to knows Animate the Dead, he can substitute a dead (and thus soulless) animated body for 
			a living one. The animated corpse will then function with the Sagacity of the soul inhabiting it, and is unable 
			to disobey the sorcerer’s direct orders, as is normal for animated corpses.</p>
			
			<p>If the sorcerer uses the conjured soul’s body, the animation of the corpse lasts indefinitely – the soul 
			inhabits an undead (but deathless) body, potentially forever. Forcing a deceased’s soul back into a body will 
			most likely result in a deranged version of the original person. The more Casting Successes the sorcerer 
			achieves, the more likely that the resulting compound of soul and body will be sane.</p>
			
			<p>Achieving but a single Success signifies total and utter madness, and more Successes makes the resulting 
			being increasingly normal. Six Successes are required for complete sanity.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Blight">Blight</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Cursing</em></p>
			<p>In a ritual of roughly one hour’s duration, the sorcerer curses a land and afflicts it with a terrible 
			blight. A single “unit” of land with either geographical (ex. a valley or an island) or political (ex. a 
			county or a city state) boundaries of up to about 5.000 km² can be affected. The sorcerer makes the Casting 
			Check with the worse of her Goety or Cursing.</p>
			
			<p>Every Success reduces the yield of next harvest by about a third, applicable to all agricultural produce 
			either animal or vegetable. Three Successes destroy a harvest utterly. Any Successes over 3 either extend the 
			duration by doubling the number of harvests destroyed or doubles the number of adjacent “units” of land 
			affected (caster’s choice), or a combination thereof. Seven Successes will, for example, utterly destroy the 
			next sixteen harvests, or this harvest for sixteen regions, or any combination.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ChariotOfSorcery">Chariot of Sorcery</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Necromancy</em></p>
			<p>By means of this ritual, the sorcerer permanently enchants a vehicle over the course of one week to one 
			month. With 1 Success on the Casting Check (made with the worse of either Goety or Necromancy) the vehicle may 
			be the size of a chariot, palanquin or rowboat. Additional Successes can be expended to allow for larger 
			vehicles. 1 additional Success allows for a vehicle the size of a carriage or small sailboat, 2 for one the 
			size a very small ship, 3 for one the size of small to mid-sized ship, etc.</p>
			
			<p>Successes can also be expended to purchase sorcerous qualities for the vehicle. 1 Success may purchase:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>An untiring crew or team</li>
				
				<li>The capability to move without crew or team (requires an untiring crew having been purchased)</li>
				
				<li>An unusual type of locomotion (ex. flying, diving, or burrowing) at a reasonable base speed</li>
				
				<li>Being faster than normal by 50% (per Success)</li>
				
				<li>Being bigger on the inside than on the outside by 50% (per Success)</li>
				
				<li>Locomotion for a structure that isn’t a vehicle (ex. a walking hut)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The vehicle will always be conspicuously sorcerous in nature. If the sorcerer wants it to look mundane and 
			innocuous, he is obliged to spend 1 Casting Success to purchase such a glamour. Usually, the vehicle can only 
			utilize its sorcerous means of locomotion if the sorcerer who has created it is on board, though it may be 
			appropriate to allow any sorcerer of sufficient might to control the craft.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_EldritchEffigies">Eldritch Effigies</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Enslavement</em></p>
			<p>By use of this sorcerous ritual of a single Limelight duration, the sorcerer splits herself into as many 
			versions of herself as she achieves Casting Successes. Depending on the setting these new versions of herself 
			may either step out of her, or simply appear in her vicinity. The simulacra must stay in each other's presence. 
			While they need not engage in identical activities, they can only engage in <em>similar</em> activities. If one 
			engages in conversation, the others must speak as well or at least look at the speaker. If one is resting, the 
			others can't run or walk around. If one is fighting, the rest fight as well (though, not necessarily the same 
			person) or at least circle an opponent warily. If one is reading, the others can't sleep, run around, fight, or 
			chat. While the effigies do not have to move in identical ways, what they are doing needs to mirror what all 
			the others are doing. The exception to this is that it is always possible for the sorcerer to will one or more 
			effigies to remain completely passive.</p>
			
			<p>Effigies are completely real, and can be interacted with in any way a human can. This extends to their 
			clothing and personal effects, though these can neither be given nor wrested away. Should a possession pass 
			from an effigy, both effigy and item immediately dissolve unless it is the effigy currently housing the 
			sorcerer’s essence (see below), in which case the possession passes from the effigy and vanishes from all 
			the others.</p>
			
			<p>While all the effigies are the sorcerer, both real and sorcerous in nature, only one holds the sorcerer’s 
			essence at any given time. Which one is utterly indiscernible, and the sorcerer may change this instantly. 
			Theoretically, she could easily shift her essence a dozen times within the span of a single Exchange. Should 
			the effigy holding her essence be killed or knocked out, the sorcerer will have ample time to shift her essence 
			to another.</p>
			
			<p>In combat, every effigy suffers wounds, Shock, Pain, Blood Loss, etc. individually. The sorcerer suffers 
			from the wound effects of the effigy currently housing her essence. After this sorcery has run its course, she 
			retains the wound affecting the final effigy she inhabited at its end, which may be none at all. It does not 
			matter what the other effigies have suffered.</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer may also work sorcery while split into several effigies, but only with the effigy currently 
			housing her essence. While she invokes sorcery, the other effigies will either remain passive or very closely 
			mirror his words and gestures, in which case the sorcery will manifest in a manner that doesn't give away which 
			effigy has actually worked the spell.</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer can dissolve any or all of the effigies at any time, but can only maintain a single casting of 
			this Secret at once (she can't, for instance, cast and maintain two instances of Eldtrich Effigies at once). 
			If she does not do so prematurely, the Effigies will fade at the end of the scene, or after about half an hour, 
			whatever is most appropriate.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Firestorm">Firestorm</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Cursing & Witchfire</em></p>
			<p>This Arcane Secret imparts knowledge of a ritual of three Limelights’ duration and allows the sorcerer to 
			spread out the effect of his Witchfire Mystery over a vast area, targeting everybody within it. The affected 
			area must somehow be logically delineated, like an army, a fleet, a castle, a village, or a city (which is 
			about the largest area that can be affected). A storm of Witchfire attacks will erupt in this area, targeting 
			people within it at random and lasting for one Limelight (or about 30 seconds) per Success on the Casting Check 
			made with the worse Sorcery Pool of either Cursing or Witchfire.</p>
			
			<p>During this time a base of about 50 people will be hit (not merely attacked) by Witchfire. This number 
			doubles with every additional Casting Success. A Firestorm called down upon an army with 7 Casting Successes 
			would therefore roll over that army for about three to four minutes and strike roughly 3200 people. Considering 
			the raw power of any sorcerer knowing Firestorm, all normal victims of it can be considered killed or nearly 
			dead.</p>
			
			<p>If special Characters (like Players) are among the group affected, it should be randomly determined whether 
			they are attacked or not, based upon the actual statistical likelihood of this occurring, though slanted
			towards an attack occurring. If the Character is attacked, the original Casting dice are rolled again against a 
			Target Number of 6 for a Quality of Success of the hit. This attack can be defended against as per the rules 
			for Witchfire. If he is hit, the Impact Rating is equal (Quality of Success + the Casting Successes) rolled.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_HandOfDoom">Hand of Doom</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Necromancy</em></p>
			<p>This is a dreadful Arcane Secret that can be cast almost instantaneously. The sorcerer calls words of power 
			and extends her hand towards a target no more than 10 meters away and invokes certain entities. She then makes 
			a Casting Check with the worse of her Goety or Necromancy, which the victim can resist with Tenacity. If the 
			victim is victorious or ties the sorcerer, she feels merely intense pain, the equivalent of Pain equal to the 
			dice in the sorcerer’s pool for this Arcane Secret; this Pain is halved with every passing Combat Round until 
			it disappears, and is unreduced by Tenacity. However, if the sorcerer is victorious by even a single Success, 
			one of the victim’s organs (sorcerer’s choice) will burst out of the victim’s body, ripping through any 
			clothing or armour, and jump into the sorcerer’s outstretched hand.</p>
			
			<p>Alternatively, the sorcerer can decide to rip off a limb, including the head. Depending on the organ, death 
			is either instant or follows within seconds from blood loss and system shock.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_MasterTheBeast">Master the Beast</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Enslavement</em></p>
			<p>This short ritual, easily completed within a single Limelight, calls local animals into the sorcerer’s 
			presence, enables them to understand his wishes and forces them to his bidding for the duration of the current 
			scene, after which they will disperse. Animals begin to arrive in the sorcerer’s presence as soon as he 
			finishes the ritual, and continue to arrive in great numbers – greater numbers than could conceivably exist in 
			the sorcerer’s vicinity. It is theorized that this Arcane Secret not only calls animals, but actually brings 
			them into being.</p>
			
			<p>The type of animals is always a specific, locally existing species, and the species that can be called must 
			be one that has something sinister to it. Scorpions, snakes, spiders, crows, and wolves are possible, but 
			doves, horses and rabbits are not. In some settings, there may be further limitations as to the species that 
			can be invoked.</p>
			
			<p>The Casting Check is made out of the worse of the sorcerer’s Goety or Enslavement pool, and every Success 
			results in about 150 small animals (scorpions and spiders) answering the call, about 50 mid-sized animals 
			(jackals and vultures), or about 15 large animals (crocodiles).</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_MoldTheFlesh">Mold the Flesh</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Necromancy</em></p>
			<p>This Arcane Secret imparts knowledge of a surprisingly short ritual, easily completed in a single Limelight 
			that allows the sorcerer to temporarily shift her shape into another creature’s, and attaining all this 
			creature’s physical characteristics.</p>
			
			<p>Mechanically, the worse of the sorcerer’s Goety or Necromancy pool is checked, with the changed shape being 
			held for 15 minutes per success; she can however end the sorcery and shift back at any time. Exactly what 
			animal shape can be assumed will vary from campaign to campaign, but as a guideline should be one between one 
			twentieth and five-times the sorcerer’s mass.</p>
			
			<p>Normally, it will have to be a type of animal that has something sinister to it (see Master the Beast), but 
			if the GM waives this requirement, she is encouraged to instead limit the power of this Arcane Secret by having 
			it impart the ability to shift into one specific type of animal, and require it to be “rediscovered” for every 
			additional species.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_PlagueWind">Plague Wind</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Necromancy & Mending</em></p>
			<p>This Arcane Secret imparts knowledge of how to conduct a lengthy ritual requiring several hours to complete 
			that afflicts an area with a deadly plague. The area where the plague first appears must have a distinct 
			political or geographical boundary (as with Blight) but it will spread naturally beyond this area.</p>
			
			<p>For every Success on the Casting Check, made with the worse of Mending or Necromancy, about 10% of the 
			people in the boundary at the time of the casting will contract the plague; some immediately, and some as much 
			as ten days after the casting. Of those who contract it, (50% + 5%) per Casting Success will die from it.</p>
			
			<p>Casting Successes also give a gauge of how easy it is for people not originally within the area affected by 
			the Arcane Secret to contract the plague later on: 1 Success would mean that actual ingesting of bodily fluids 
			is necessary to contract it, while 10 Successes would mean that just being within a few meters of a plague 
			carrier would suffice.</p>
			
			<p>The severity of the plague deteriorates over time. Every week after the casting, the effective number of 
			Casting Successes is reduced by 1. Still, application of this Arcane Secret could depopulate a country.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Portal">Portal</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisites: Goety & Necromancy</em></p>
			<p>By use of this ritual, the sorcerer establishes a link between two locales, no matter how distant, 
			effectively conjoining those locales and allowing things and beings from one to pass through to the other.</p>
			
			<p>Opening a portal to a location the sorcerer is currently seeing or familiar with requires one Casting 
			Success on the Check made with the worse of either Goety or Necromancy. A portal to a place she has only 
			visited once or twice requires 2 Successes, and one to a place she has never visited but is well informed about 
			requires 3 Successes.</p>
			
			<p>She cannot open a gateway to any locale she has no knowledge of. The aspects of the portal that may be 
			crafted fall under these broad categories:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Direction - A portal is usually two-way. Making it one-way uses up 1 Success. This being reversed may 
					be more appropriate for some settings</li>
				
				<li>Access - By default, portals are open to anyone. Limiting it to the sorcerer’s use alone (in any or 
					all directions) uses up 1 Success.</li>
				
				<li>Size - By default, the portal admits up to human-sized creatures or things. Widening it to admit large 
					ones uses up 1 Success, and huge ones yet another Success. Expending a third Success makes it large

				<li>Duration - A portal stays open for a single Combat Round. Expending additional Successes extends this to 
					a Limelight, a scene (or about half an hour), a day, a month, a year, a decade, and permanent, in this 
					order</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The sorcerer must delineate these desired properties before the Check is made. If the necessary successes 
			fall short, the portal either does not open, or is unstable, and before failing generates a unique Complication 
			related to some property of the portal, collapsing on any who dare to brave it.</p>
			
			<p>The ritual to establish this gateway usually requires about an hour, but in an emergency, the sorcerer may 
			violently rip it open in a single Combat Round. This requires three times the ordinary number of total Casting 
			Successes for the desired portal.</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_ShakeTheBonesOfTheEarth">Shake the Bones of the Earth</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisite: Goety</em></p>
			<p>With this ritual’s duration of about an hour or two, the sorcerer creates a violent earthquake. The effect 
			is slightly setting-specific, as its mechanics orient themselves after the sturdiest building technique and 
			materials available in the campaign. For every Success of the Casting Check made with the worse of Goety or 
			Witchfire, about 5% of the buildings of this top durability are completely destroyed by the earthquake and 
			another 10% are heavily damaged. Flimsier buildings are affected to an even greater degree.</p>
			
			<p>The area affected at full strength has a diameter of about half a kilometre, with areas farther out being 
			struck by smaller tremors. The epicentre of the full strength is surrounded by concentric rings of about 
			half a kilometre each, with each being affected with a severity of 1 less Success. Alternatively, the sorcerer 
			may forgo to have anything outside the epicenter affected, invoking a blatantly sorcerous, sharply delineated 
			earthquake.</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_WhisperMyNameInFear">Whisper My Name in Fear</p>
			<p><em>Prerequisite: Prophecy & Scrying</em></p>
			<p>Once a sorcerer learns this Secret, he will know from that moment on whenever his name is spoken anywhere 
			in the world. If somebody utters the sorcerer’s name, the sorcerer immediately and unfailingly learns this 
			person’s name, location, identity (ex. farmer, nobleman, soldier, etc.), in what context his name was spoken 
			(ex. hostile, reverential, in awe, plotting, etc.), and also the names and identities of this person’s 
			interlocutors. There is no Check involved. In short, the sorcerer cannot be spoken of anymore without him 
			becoming aware of it.</p>
			
			<p>The one chance to avoid drawing the sorcerer’s attention is not using his name, but referring to him 
			obliquely. Speaking about the sorcerer in such a way requires an Amazing Cunning Check (four successes) for it 
			to avoid notice. If this is done in either hushed tones or in a completely enclosed space, the Challenge Level 
			becomes merely Difficult (three successes) or Challenging (two successes) if both is the case. However, this is 
			far from common knowledge. While it may be a part of common folklore that speaking a sorcerer’s name is bad 
			luck (requiring one success on an Occultism Check to have heard of), knowing about the effectiveness of 
			whispering would be a Difficult Occultism Check (three successes), and about that of enclosed spaces an Amazing 
			one (four successes).</p>
			
			<p>Gaining the knowledge of being spoken about does not divert the sorcerer’s attention or disrupt his 
			concentration in any way. Even if a thousand people were to speak about him at the same time this would not 
			disrupt the sorcerer’s present doings in any way; he just knows, without the knowledge drawing his attention 
			away from anything else.</p>
