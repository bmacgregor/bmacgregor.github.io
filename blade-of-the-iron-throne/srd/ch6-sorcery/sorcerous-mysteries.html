			<p class="h4">The Lesser Mysteries</p>
			<p>The six lesser Mysteries are:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Cursing</li>
				<li>Enslavement</li>
				<li>Mending</li>
				<li>Prophecy</li>
				<li>Scrying</li>

			<p class="h4" id="P_LSR_Cursing">Cursing</p>
			<p>Cursing is the art of placing a doom on someone. Curses are best placed on someone in the sorcerer’s 
			immediate presence, but if the victim of the curse is not present, the sorcerer must at least know the victim 
			and have either a close personal possession (a piece of well-worn clothing or other item to which the victim is 
			emotionally attached), or a body part or secretion (hair, saliva, fingernails, etc.) of the victim at hand.</p>
			
			<p>In this case, a small ritual of about five minutes is necessary to place the curse. However, if the victim 
			is in the sorcerer’s immediate presence – no more than a stone’s throw – the curse can be placed in a single 
			combat round, simply by uttering the curse formula and pointing at the victim.</p>
			
			<p>To curse someone, the sorcerer makes his Casting Check as an Opposed Check against the victim’s Tenacity. A 
			targeted sorcerer (A to C Sorcery Priority) may opt instead to use his Power instead of Tenacity to oppose this 
			Mystery. Should he also know the Cursing Mystery himself, receives bonus dice equal to half of his Power, 
			though no more than his rating in the Cursing Mystery to add to his choice of Tenacity or Power for the 
			Opposed Check. If the victim equals or surpasses the sorcerer’s Casting Successes, the curse does not take 
			effect. If the sorcerer is victorious, his curse takes hold.</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer’s total Successes, not just those surpassing the victim’s Successes, translate into a curse 
			rating, which works much like a Passion Attribute. Whenever the cursed Character makes a Check to avoid 
			dire consequences, the curse’s rating is either subtracted from the number of dice he rolls, or is added to the 
			dice pool of whoever is opposing him (but not both).</p>
			
			<p>Each time the curse causes something bad to happen to the Character, the rating drops by 2 until it is 
			finally reduced to 0, at which time the curse will have run its course. Barring that, the only other way to get 
			rid of the curse is to have it lifted.</p>
			
			<p>A sorcerer can also curse a victim with a specific doom. In this case, the curse rating is not equal to the 
			Casting Successes; if the specific doom is merely unpleasant, the curse rating is 1 point less than the number 
			of Casting Successes; if it is something very serious that would be hard to put right again, the curse rating 
			is 2 points less; and if it is something deadly or utterly ruinous the curse rating is 3 points less. Should 
			the resulting curse rating drop below 1, the curse fails to take hold.</p>
			
			<p>Curses of this type in any case works very similar to a curse of bad fortune, but instead of applying to all 
			Checks to avoid something bad happening, it is subtracted either from <em>all</em> of the cursed Character’s 
			dice pools to avoid the specific doom, or added to <em>all</em> die pools of people working to bring the doom 
			about (again, not both in the same instance).</p>
			
			<p>This type of curse lasts until it is lifted, or until the doom has come to pass. Lifting a curse requires a 
			Mending spell to be cast upon the cursed Character that achieves more Successes than the original Casting 
			Successes (which can be different from the curse rating).</p>
			
			<p>Alternatively, if the cursed Character has a faith-related Passion Attribute he can, at a suitable locale, 
			make an offering to his deity and ask for remittance of the curse. To do so, the Character Checks the relevant 
			Passion Attribute against a Target Number of 7. If he achieves Successes at least equal to the curse rating, 
			the curse lifted, fewer Successes have no effect at all. This is all-or-nothing, and it can only be attempted 
			once per curse.</p>
			
			<p><em>Optional: A dying curse is a mainstay of sorcerers everywhere. Such a curse will be powerful, since the 
			sorcerer need not worry about Containing the spell, but if this rule is in effect, it can be made even more 
			powerful. A dying curse can always be uttered, no matter how instant the manner of the sorcerer’s death, and is 
			made with a –2 Casting bonus to the Target Number.</em></p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LSR_Enslavement">Enslavement</p>
			<p>With the Mystery of Enslavement, the sorcerer forces her will on her victims’, right up to the point where 
			the sorcerer commands her victim’s view of reality. In essence, it's a kind of high-powered hypnosis. This 
			Mystery requires neither formulas nor gestures, just that the sorcerer makes eye contact with her victim.</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer <strong>first</strong> makes his Casting Check, which the victim can oppose with the better of 
			her Tenacity or Sagacity. A sorcerous victim (A to C Sorcery Priority) may opt to use Power instead of Tenacity 
			or Sagacity to oppose the Mystery. Should she also know the Enslavement Mystery, she gets additional bonus dice 
			equal to half of her Power (though no more than her rating in the Enslavement Mystery) to her choice of 
			Tenacity, Sagacity, or Power. If the sorcerer is victorious, the victim begins gazing into the sorcerer’s eyes, 
			forgetting everything else, and is largely motionless, oblivious to everything around her.</p>

			<p>As long as the sorcerer maintains unbroken eye contact, the victim cannot snap out of her trance, and is 
			unable to take action, even if her life is in serious danger; she is like a rabbit before a snake. Any sharp 
			pain will tear the victim out of the trance – a slap to the face is insufficient, but a hard punch to the 
			stomach will suffice.</p>
			
			<p>Apart from filching a Character’s pockets or just slitting her throat, a sorcerer can use Enslavement to 
			achieve one of two effects on the victim:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li><p>A sorcerer can command her victim to do something, anything, really. The sorcerer tells the victim 
				in a language the victim can understand what to do, and makes another Casting Check Opposed by the better 
				of the victim’s Sagacity or Tenacity. For the attacking sorcerer, while this second Check must be made with 
				the same base number of dice as the original, additional bonus dice equal to the Quality of Success from 
				the first Check are added as bonus dice. This second check does not necessitate another Containment Check. 
				Sorcerous targets do not gain any benefits from their own knowledge of the occult in resisting the 
				Enslavement. Their supernatural defences have already been invaded by the previous Opposed Check.</p>
				
				<p>If the victim at least ties the sorcerer, she immediately snaps out of the ensorcelment and is once again 
				her own master. If the sorcerer is victorious, the victim will carry out the command, no matter what. If 
				the command is more than one single, concrete action, like disembowelling oneself, or jumping down a cliff 
				or striking at somebody, its fulfilment can take no longer than about one minute per Casting Success of 
				the sorcerer (the total Successes, not just the surpassing ones).</p>
				
				<p>Such a command must be a simple action; a single, concrete thing. It can encompass walking to a locale 
				where the mission can be fulfilled, but it cannot include sub-clauses or follow-ups. During the pursuit of 
				this command, the enslaved Character moves in a trance, unable to react to people and events outside of 
				her command’s scope; she won’t be even conscious of them. Once the command is carried out, the ensorcelled 
				person will stand inactive for the remainder of the Enslavement’s duration, after which she will regain her 
				senses and a hazy memory of what has transpired.</p></li>
				
				<li><p>In the victim’s mind, one thing in her vicinity appears as something completely different. The 
				sorcerer must tell the enslaved person what the thing “really” is (“What a fool you are, to wear a reptile 
				about your waist!”), and the victim will react as if the object actually were what she is told it is, 
				providing any movement or action of the hallucination from her own imagination. </p>
				
				<p>The limit to this suggestive power is that any object can only appear as something of a similar shape and 
				size – sword to snake, horse to tiger, one man to another, cup to tarantula, etc. To befuddle somebody, the 
				sorcerer makes a second Casting Check, again Opposed by the better of the victim’s Sagacity or Tenacity.</p>
				
				<p>The number of Casting dice used is the same as the dice used in the original Casting Check, but with the 
				addition of bonus dice equal to the Quality of Success from the initial Check added. There is no need for a 
				Containment Check. Again, sorcerous targets receive no special benefits to resist this Check.</p>
				
				<p>If the victim at least ties the sorcerer, she will immediately snap out of the hypnotic trance. If the 
				sorcerer is victorious, the affected Character sees the object as what she is told it is and will act 
				accordingly – the hallucination is fuelled by the Character’s imagination and expectations. If anything 
				hallucinatory happens that would cause the death of the victim (ex. a bite from a poisonous animal, or 
				having her throat torn out by a predator), the victim passes out and must pass a Tenacity Check of Average 
				difficulty (one success) to avoid dying from the shock.</p>
				
				<p>If nothing of the kind happens, the befuddled state lasts for as many Limelights as the sorcerer had 
				Successes on her Casting Check (the total Successes, not just the surpassing ones), after which time the 
				victim will regain her senses.</p></li>
			</ol>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LSR_Mending">Mending</p>
			<p>The Mending Mystery can be used to aid and speed up the recovery from injuries, though it does not normally 
			heal them immediately. The Casting Check is made Unopposed, and the resulting number of Successes is divided 
			into two equal halves.</p>
			
			<p>The first (and smaller, if applicable) half is the combined Pain rating that is deducted from all the target 
			Character’s current wounds. These deductions must be spread among the injuries as evenly as possible. If, for 
			instance, three Pain is deducted from a Character’s three wounds, 1 Pain would be subtracted from every wound, 
			if from his two wounds, 1 Pain would be subtracted from one and 2 Pain from the other.</p>
			
			<p>The other (and larger, if applicable) half of the Casting Successes speeds up subsequent wound recovery. 
			Under normal circumstances, healing Checks are made every seven days, but if a Character has been treated with 
			the Mending Mystery this interval is halved, once for each one of the second half of the Casting Successes.</p>
			
			<p>For example, if 6 Casting Successes are achieved, putting 3 into the second half of the Successes, healing 
			Checks are made every day (first Success halves the interval from 7 to 4 days, the second Success halves the 
			interval from 4 to 2 days, and the third Success halves the interval from 2 to 1 day).</p>
			
			<p>A Character cannot benefit from the Mending Mystery until all such magically treated wounds have fully 
			healed. New injuries sustained during this time can only be treated with Mending once all previously majicked 
			wounds have healed. Healing Checks for these are made at the normal interval of every seven days.</p>
			
			<p>Mending can also be used to lift a curse (from the Lesser Mystery of this name). More Casting Successes than 
			were achieved to with Cursing Mystery are necessary to break the curse. The Mending Mystery will also aid and 
			speed up recovery from diseases to a comparable degree than from wounds, but as Sword & Sorcery tales do not 
			concern themselves with things as mundane as diseases, no mechanics are provided. Should this aspect of the 
			Mystery be needed for flavour, the effects should be estimated.</p>
			
			<p>The Mystery can also be used maliciously, to inflict pain upon someone. This can be done to a victim who 
			is either present, or a distant victim of whom the sorcerer owns either a close personal possession (well-worn 
			clothing, item to which the victim is emotionally attached, etc) or a body part or secretion (hair, nail 
			clippings, blood, etc). In the latter case, a small ritual of five to ten minutes is necessary. In the former 
			case, the sorcery can be worked much quicker, merely and is done by pointing out the victim and intoning a 
			spell aloud.</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer’s Casting Check is resisted by the victim’s Tenacity. Targeted sorcerers (A to C Sorcery 
			Priority) may opt to use their Power instead of Tenacity to oppose. Should they also know the Mending Mystery, 
			they receive additional bonus dice equal to half their Power (though no more than their rating in the Mending 
			Mystery) to their choice of Tenacity or Power. If the sorcerer achieves more Successes than his victim, the 
			victim immediately feels intense stabs of pain, corresponding to a Pain rating equal to three times the 
			sorcerer’s total (not just surpassing) Casting Successes.</p>
			
			<p>This Pain, from which Tenacity is subtracted as usual, persists for as long as the sorcerer focuses his 
			attention on the victim, and increases by 3 with every subsequent Limelight. Should the sorcerer be distracted 
			from the victim or chooses to end the effect, Pain drains away at a rate of 3 points every Limelight. Sorcerers 
			proficient in the Mending Mystery have to decide whether they want to devote themselves to its beneficent or 
			malicious use.</p>
			
			<p>The aspect that they opt for as their main use of the Mystery has the usual Casting and Containment Target 
			Numbers, and the opposite suffers a +2 Target Number penalty for both Casting <em>and</em> Containment.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LSR_Prophecy">Prophecy</p>
			<p>Prophecy is the art of seeing into the future and divining something that is not readily apparent. The kinds 
			of questions that can be answered by Prophecy fall into two categories; the broader “Will I succeed?” or 
			“Should I continue?” type of questions, and the much more specific “Who is...” or “Where is...” 
			type.</p>
			
			<p>To answer either, the sorcerer needs to utilize a Prophecy ritual specific to the setting and her own 
			preferences: It might be prophetic dreams, stargazing, the casting of bones, reading tarot cards, studying the 
			entrails of sacrificial animals, and much more. For the broad type of question, the Player first states whether 
			she’d like a negative or positive answer to the question and then makes a Casting Check. If the answer 
			is obvious to the Game Master, she simply decides on “yes” or “no”. If it isn’t, she rolls a d12 and subtracts 
			one third the sorcerer’s Casting Successes if the Player wanted a positive answer, or adding this number if the 
			Player wished for a negative one. A result of 1-5 yields a “yes”, 6-7 is indifferent, and 8-12 is “no”. 
			Regardless of the answer, it translates into an Omen rating of 1, which functions like a Passion Attribute.</p>
			
			<p>The Omen rating is added to all Checks to bring about a result in accordance with the answer, and subtracted 
			from all Checks to bring about a result contrary to the answer. The more specific type of question - things 
			like something’s or someone’s location or identity - is not as easily cast into rules. A correct answer 
			will require any number of Successes deemed appropriate by the GM, with 1 success sufficient for trivial 
			questions (like the location of a misplaced item), while divining the identity of an unseen mastermind 
			behind some hardly grasped intrigue would for instance require at least 6 Successes, possibly more.</p>
			
			<p>If insufficient Successes are achieved, the Prophecy is inconclusive, but if the Casting Check is a Botch, 
			the resultant Complication is an answer that is either dangerously ambiguous or outright maliciously 
			misleading.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LSR_Scrying">Scrying</p>
			<p>The Mystery of Scrying is the practice of sending one’s consciousness, spirit, astral body, or soul away 
			from one’s physical self, having it travel quickly to distant places to spy out what is happening there. To do 
			so, the sorcerer enters a deep trance, usually aided by mind-altering drugs. Depending on the specifics of the 
			setting, certain paraphernalia, like mirrors or crystals to gaze into, might also be necessary.</p>
			
			<p>While his body is senseless, his consciousness rises out of it, and is able to pass unseen and unfelt 
			through all matter, and capable of travelling at vast speeds. This immaterial embodiment of the sorcerer is 
			unable to affect the physical world, but it can observe and listen in on what is taking place in it. Once the 
			sorcerer’s magical trance is sufficiently deep (taking anywhere from ten minutes to over an hour) he makes a 
			Casting Check.</p>
			
			<p>For every Success, depending on the setting or the sorcerous tradition employed, he can either stay out of 
			his body for five minutes while traveling at about 600 km an hour, or for half an hour while travelling at 200 
			km an hour. The more Successes he achieves, the longer his consciousness can stay away from his body, and the 
			more distant the places his consciousness may visit. At the end of this timespan, the consciousness will snap 
			back into the physical self and the sorcerer will awaken, usually disoriented, fatigued, or hung over.</p>
			
			<p>He can elect to have his consciousness return before the maximum time is up, but he is entirely unconscious 
			of what is happening around and to his body while his sorcerous self is travelling to distant places. Wounds, 
			danger, or discomfort will come to his attention only when he comes out of his magical trance. Should his body 
			die while it is in trance, so does the embodiment of his consciousness, and the soul then goes to whatever 
			place souls go after death.</p>
			
			<p>The presence of a scrying consciousness cannot be noticed by humans, save those with the Detect Sorcery 
			Skill, who can make a Check to sense a presence, and to other sorcerers who know the Mystery of Scrying and 
			who will detect the presence of a scryer’s sorcerous vision on a single Success on an Unopposed Sagacity Check, 
			and are able to see the presence as a kind of astral body with two Successes.</p>
			
			<p>Disembodied spirits can detect a sorcerer’s consciousness automatically, as can many supernatural beings 
			like demons or ghosts. Many of these entities may even be able to interact with the spiritual body, possibly 
			even harming it as if it were physical. Should the astral body be killed by such an attack, the sorcerer’s 
			physical body dies as well.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_LSR_Witchfire">Witchfire</p>
			<p>The Witchfire Mystery unleashes energies to damage or outright destroy inanimate and animate things. Despite 
			the Mystery’s name, those energies need not manifest as fire, but can take any number of forms depending on the 
			setting and the sorcerous tradition employed. It can be beams of searing light from the sorcerer’s eyes, bolts 
			of fire leaping from her fingertips, a spectral vortex of slavering demonic shapes, lightning or pillars of 
			fire from the sky, a dagger appearing in the sorcerer’s hands and launched by her, and a thousand other things. 
			It can even be innocuous, and take the form of a handy object striking the target, like masonry collapsing, or 
			a horse kicking it.</p>

			<p>In game terms, Witchfire manifests as a ranged weapon of the launched type without the capability to attack 
			at Extreme Range, and with an Archery Pool cost for every +/– 1, taken from one Range band worse than the 
			actual attack (ex. Near to Extreme). Witchfire is notoriously hard to aim precisely.</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer utilizing Witchfire makes Casting and Containment Checks as normal. Any Casting Successes 
			double as both the Witchfire’s eventual Damage Rating and as Proficiency dice for the Archery Pool, which is 
			equal to (Aim + Successes).</p>
			
			<p>Defence against Witchfire is possible though Blocking and Evasion, the same as dealing with launched 
			missiles such as arrows and bolts, however, to defend against it, the target must realize in time what is 
			coming her way. Most targets will need to pass a Surprise Check of Challenge Level 4, even if they are watching 
			the sorcerer intently.</p>
			
			<p>Any previous experience with Witchfire makes this Check one degree easier, as will previous experience with 
			Witchfire from the same sorcerer, and already having been attacked by Witchfire in the same Scene, for a 
			minimum Challenge Level of 1 if all three apply. A successful Precognition Skill Check does away with the need 
			for a Surprise Check, as does any degree of the Occultism Skill, unless the target is in a situation where she 
			would have to Check for Surprise even for a mundane attack. If the Witchfire strike is successful, hit location 
			is determined as with any other missile weapon.</p>
			
			<p>The hit’s Impact Rating is calculated by adding the original Casting Successes to the Quality of Success of 
			the attack Roll (Quality of Success + Casting Successes). Both Brawn and Armour Value protects against 
			Witchfire as normal. The Damage Table and Armour Values used are the ones most closely corresponding to the 
			manifestation of Witchfire, or Cleaving if none seems to fit outright.</p>
			
			<p>The eldritch nature of sorcerers offers them additional protection against Witchfire. Any sorcerous 
			Character (A through C Sorcery Priority) can use half her Power Attribute as additional Armour Value against 
			Witchfire strikes, or their full Power if they know the Witchfire Mystery themselves.</p>
			
			<p>Characters built with the E or F Sorcery Priorities are particularly vulnerable against Witchfire and may 
			not use their Brawn ratings to soak up damage from it.</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_GRT_Overview">Greater Mystery Overview</p>
			<p>The two Greater Mysteries are:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Goety</li>
				<li>Necromancy</li>
			</ul>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_GRT_Goety">Goety</p>
			<p>One of the two greater Mysteries, this is the sorcery of conjuration, command, and banishment of 
			supernatural creatures from beyond the boundaries of the world. From where these creatures originate is 
			specific to the setting – they may be from out of the dark between the stars, from other dimensions, from alien 
			planets light years away, or some other unfathomably strange place. The attitude of these demons towards 
			humanity and the sorcerer also varies with the setting – it may be anything from annoyed irritation to haughty 
			expectations of worship to all-consuming hatred.</p>
			
			<p>Whatever it is, it is never friendly. The Occultism Skill provides knowledge on the outlook of demons, or at 
			least what their outlook is perceived to be. The type of ritual required to conjure a demon depends on the 
			flavour of the setting.</p>
			
			<p>The three necessary components of conjuration in all settings are purification of the sorcerer (which might 
			take anywhere from under an hour to over a day, depending on the setting), a ritual taking from under ten 
			minutes to over an hour, and a blood sacrifice. The minimum sacrifice that is acceptable depends on the setting. 
			Examples include large animals, a human being, or a virgin.</p>
			
			<p>To conjure the demon, the sorcerer makes his Casting Check. His Sorcery pool for this Casting Check is 
			modified by the result of a Difficult Occultism Check (three successes); every Success the Occultism Check is 
			short of the required 3 successes penalizes the Sorcery Pool by 1 die, while every Success over 3 adds 1 die to 
			the pool. The second modifier is the extent of the sacrifice.</p>
			
			<p>The minimum sacrifice required adds nothing, but every ‘step up’ from this base (mammal to man, man to 
			virgin, etc) adds 1 extra die, as does every time the minimum is multiplied by 10. If the minimum acceptable 
			sacrifice is a human being and the sorcerer offers up 10 virgins he receives 2 bonus dice to his Sorcery Pool. 
			For the practiced sorcerer, piercing the divides to the realms where demons dwell isn’t difficult, but finding 
			the demon he <em>wants</em> to conjure may well be. The search for the right one takes time, during which the 
			sorcerer’s consciousness is in close contact with an alien realm, exposing him to massive degrees of Taint. To 
			successfully conjure a demon into his presence, the sorcerer needs to achieve 1 Success on his Casting Check. 
			However, for the summoned demon to be the right one, five Casting Successes are necessary.</p>
			
			<p>If the wrong demon is called forth, its exact type depends on the GM’s approach to demons. Some Game Masters 
			might enjoy statting out long catalogues of demons, from which the sorcerer may choose one to conjure; if 
			that's the case, the GM chooses another demon from the catalogue, its difference in stats and powers to the 
			desired one being 1 point less or greater per each Casting Success short of 5. Other Game Masters may allow 
			players to stat out their own demons; in this case, the GM changes the Attribute total of the arriving demon by 
			2 points per Casting Success short of 5, or adds or subtracts one special power per Casting Success short. 
			Please note that all the changes should either make the demon more or less powerful – which one should be 
			determined randomly. Whatever the approach, the sorcerer has to state what demon he wants to conjure before the 
			dice are rolled, either by choosing one from a list or by statting it out.</p>
			
			<p>Should the sorcerer achieve more than 5 Casting Successes, the extra Successes carry over as bonus dice to 
			his Sorcery Pool for the next stage of the summoning, the Coercion Check. This Check represents the sorcerer 
			bargaining with the demon, or intimidating it into compliance and is a second Casting Check, with a Sorcery 
			Pool already impacted by any Taint the sorcerer may have picked up during the summoning itself. The demon 
			Opposes this Casting Check with its worst Attribute, with a +1 die donus added for every special power it 
			possesses.</p>
			
			<p>Tying this Opposed Check yields an inconclusive outcome, with the demon departing or being pulled back from 
			whence it came. If the demon is victorious, it is unshackled from the sorcerous constraints holding it during 
			the Coercion Check, and is free to attack the summoner, depart, or stray into the world to cause havoc. How 
			long such an unbound demon may roam the world depends on the setting – it might be a day or a year per initial 
			Casting Success, as long as the sorcerer lives, or anything else. Should the demon choose to attack the 
			sorcerer and manage to incapacitate him (immobilize him through grappling, knock him out, reduce his pools to 0 
			through Pain, etc.), he may and probably will carry him off to its place of origin, never to be heard of 
			again.</p>
			
			<p>For the remainder of the scene in which the sorcerer failed his Opposed Coercion Check against the demon, 
			he is at +1 a Target Number penalty for all actions directed against the demon. In addition, and cumulative 
			with this penalty, he suffers a +2 Target Number penalty to use Goety against the demon for as long as it 
			remains free in the world.</p>
			
			<p>If the sorcerer is victorious in the Coercion Check, he may demand a number of tasks from the demon equal to 
			his Quality of Success. A task is defined as a simple, straightforward service (for instance attempting to kill 
			a single person). If the fulfillment of this task requires travel over a greater distance than a few hundred 
			meters, this counts as a separate task, as does returning to the sorcerer (should the sorcerer demand this). If 
			the place where the demon is to travel to is ill-defined or entirely undefined (such as attepmting to slay a 
			person whose current location is unknown to the sorcerer), determining the locale also counts as a separate 
			task.</p>
			
			<p>Similarly, if a task can only be accomplished in stages, each stage also counts as a task of its own. 
			Finally, if a task requires more than an hour of the demon’s time, every doubling of this initial span of time 
			also counts as a task all of its own. The exception to this is when the task is to guard a stationary person, 
			item, or locale; in this case, with no travelling required of the demon, the initial span of time for the task 
			is a day, not an hour.</p>
			
			<p>Please note that demons travel instantaneously, as long as they are not carrying living beings; if they are 
			to take along a living being, their travel times are determined by their mode and speed of locomotion.</p>
			
			<p>Examples:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><em>Fetch me the sceptre of King Yezdigerd.</em> – 4 tasks (1 base + 1 travel to location + 1 location 
				ill-defined + 1 return to sorcerer)</li>
				<li><em>Kill Conan.</em> – 3 tasks (1 base + 1 travel to location + 1 location undefined)</li>
				<li><em>Carry me to the top of Mount Yimsha.</em> – 2 tasks (1 base + 1 time), assuming a travel time of 
				over one but no more than two hours</li>
				<li><em>Fetch me the Heart of Ahriman from the vaults of the temple of Mitra.</em> – 6 tasks (1 base + 1 
				travel to location + 1 location ill-defined + 1 overcoming magical wards + 1 defeating guardian of the 
				Heart + 1 return to sorcerer), and a hefty chance of failing with ward and guardian</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>If the scope of such service is clear at the moment of the Coercion attempt, any shortage of the required 
			number of Successes results in the demon declaring that the sorcerer is asking too much and returning from 
			whence it came. If the scope is variable, such as killing an unspecified number of people or guarding something 
			for as long as possible, the demon will - provided that the sorcerer was successful at all - begin the task, 
			but will abandon it as soon as the sorcerer’s Successes are ‘spent.’</p>
			
			<p>Sometimes, a sorcerer will want to banish a demon. This is relatively straightforward in the case of a demon 
			he himself conjured, as he is already familiar with the demon and its attributes, but it is more difficult if 
			the demon was conjured by someone else. In the latter case, the sorcerer must make an Occultism Check at 
			Legendary difficulty (five successes). For every Success short of 5, his sorcery pool to banish the demon is 
			penalized by 1.</p>
			
			<p>The banishing ritual takes anywhere from half a minute to several minutes, and is setting-specific. Once the 
			ritual has been begun, the demon cannot leave the immediate surroundings of the sorcerer, but must remain 
			within earshot and sight. It may not attack the sorcerer, who is protected by the ritual he has invoked, but is 
			otherwise free to do as it pleases, including trying to kill the sorcerer’s companions, causing havoc to 
			distract the sorcerer, or by harming him indirectly (for example, setting the sorcerer’s immediate surroundings 
			ablaze).</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer’s Casting Check is Opposed by the demon’s worst Attribute, with a +1 die bonus per special power 
			it possesses. To banish a demon successfully, the sorcerer has to emerge victorious from the contest; a tie 
			or a defeat for the sorcerer allows the demon to remain. If a sorcerer successfully banishes a demon he didn't 
			conjure in the first place, he accrues only one third the normal Taint (after the Containment Check is made), 
			unless the Containment Check results in a Taint discharge, in which case he accumulates the ordinary amount of 
			Taint.</p>
			
			<p>A few guidelines to the power of demons: Demons never have Heart scores, not even the succubus-like ones. 
			Cunning is used instead, where necessary. Demons should not have Attribute scores much higher than 12, and 
			their lowest Attribute should not normally be less than a quarter of their highest. Their Proficiency scores in 
			all modes of attack should be identical to Reflex, or very close to it, or to Aim in case of ranged attacks. 
			Their Damage Rating with special forms of attack (like fire breathing) should be close to the Damage Rating of 
			more mundane forms of attack like bites. If the demon knows any Mysteries (which could have been purchased 
			as a special power), its rating in it should be identical (or close to) its Tenacity.</p>
			
			<p>Demons may have additional traits that are in line with their physical appearance – a winged demon should 
			be able to fly, and a shaggy demon should have some kind of Armour Value. Only traits that are not reflected by 
			their appearance, or that go clearly beyond anything a mundane animal might exhibit, should be regarded as 
			‘special powers’ in the sense referred to above. This includes special forms of attack like hypnosis or acid 
			spitting, any armour beyond an Armour Value 2 or not reflected by the demon’s appearance, useful special 
			abilities like regeneration or ultramundane modes of movement like shifting through walls, and anything else 
			along these lines.</p>
			
			<p>Special powers also include bulk (and the accompanying reduction of damage). A demon should receive one of 
			these traits for free only if it is large – for example, the trait ‘large’ should only be applied for free if 
			the demon is of a bulk where one would already consider assigning the trait ‘huge’; otherwise, the trait needs 
			to be purchased as a special power. If a demon who would not receive ‘large’, counting it as 'huge' costs two 
			special powers.</p>
			
			<p>Size and bulk also extend to the special trait of some large creatures to engage several opponents at once, 
			acting on their respective Limelights. Being able to engage a second opponent should only be assigned for free 
			if the demon is huge and of a bodily configuration to suggest this, otherwise, it has to be purchased as a 
			special power, as would the ability to engage every extra opponent.</p>
			
			<p>Both Players and GM should realize that Goety is powerful and versatile, and that every summoning requires 
			two Casting Checks (Conjuration and Coercion), and thus two Checks to contain Taint. Trafficking with entities 
			from beyond the human domain is a sure way to amass Taint quickly.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_GRT_Necromancy">Necromancy</p>
			<p>Necromancy deals with calling up the dead from the beyond to question the shades of the deceased, and 
			learn secrets beyond human ken. Where Goety allows the sorcerer to exert power in the world, Necromancy enables 
			her to learn things <em>about</em> the world. The core of necromancy involves calling up the spirit of 
			a particular deceased person. How this spirit manifests itself (as a traditional ghost, a disembodied voice 
			from the grave, or a vision in a mirror) is specific to the setting. In any case, the summoned spirit is unable 
			to affect the physical world, save perhaps with a Complication on its Containment Check.</p>
			
			<p>To summon a spirit from the underworld, the sorcerer must at least know the deceased’s name; if the name is 
			unknown, it cannot be summoned. The Sorcery Pool for the Necromancy Mystery is modified as follows:</p>
			
			<p>In addition to knowing the name, at least one of the following three things must also apply for the 
			summoning to be possible at all. If two of them apply, the sorcerer receives +1 to her Sorcery Pool, and +2 if 
			all three apply:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>+spec. if the sorcerer is in the presence of the person’s mortal remains</li>
				<li>+spec. if the sorcerer has one or more items at hand that were of great personal importance to the 
				person while alive </li>
				<li>+ spec. if the sorcerer is in the place where the person died, there are  further modifiers:
					<ul>
						<li>+1 if the sorcerer knew the person in life</li>
						<li>+1 if the sorcerer knows extensive and correct biographic details of the person (equivalent of 
							at least twenty pages of writing)</li>
						<li>+1 if the sorcerer is a direct descendant of the person</li>
						<li>-1 if the person has been dead for longer than a month </li>
						<li>-1 if the person has been dead for longer than a year (cumulative with above)</li>
						<li>-1 if the person has been dead for longer than 10 years (cumulative with above)</li>
						<li>-1 if the person has been dead for longer than 100 years (cumulative with above)</li>
						<li>-1 if the person has been dead for longer than 1000 years (cumulative with above)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The sorcerer makes her Casting Check, Opposed by the spirit’s Tenacity, modified cumulatively as follows:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>+1 : spirit was a powerful person (sorcerer, nobleman, wealthy merchant, ranking priest)</li>
				<li>+1 : spirit was an independent ruler or head of a cult</li>
				<li>+1 : spirit knew one or more Lesser sorcerous Mysteries</li>
				<li>+1 : spirit knew one or two Greater sorcerous Mysteries</li>
				<li>+1 : spirit knew Necromancy (cumulative with above; sorcerers knowing just Goety get +1, those knowing 
					Necromancy or both Necromancy and Goety gain +2)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>If the spirit is victorious or ties the sorcerer, the spirit does not appear, and the sorcerer cannot attempt 
			to summon this spirit again for a number of months equal to the spirit’s total number of Successes (not just 
			the surpassing ones), unless she achieves a change in summoning circumstances in her favour (ex. better 
			summoning modifiers than her last attempt).</p>
			
			<p>If the sorcerer is victorious, the spirit must answer one question per Success of the sorcerer (total 
			Successes, not just surpassing ones) to its best ability. Asking a question the spirit cannot answer uses up 
			one of the sorcerer’s questions.</p>
			
			<p>Spirits know details from their own life, but they seem to also learn from other spirits and therefore know 
			about things that have come to pass after their death, but know nothing that is only known to those still 
			alive. They keep less track of more recent events. To see whether a spirit knows the answer to any given 
			question, the spirit’s Tenacity (<em>not</em> Sagacity) is checked, with the following numbers of Successes 
			required:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>0 if it pertains to something from the spirit’s own life</li>
				<li>+1 if it pertains to something from the spirit’s walk of life that has happened in the geographical 
					area of the spirit’s life</li>
				<li>+2 if it pertains to either something from the spirit’s walk of life that has happened outside its 
					geographical area of life, or to something outside the spirit’s walk of life that has happened in its 
					geographical area of life</li>
				<li>+3 if it pertains to something both outside the spirit’s walk of life and outside its geographical area 
					of life</li>
				<li>+1 if it pertains to something that has happened either closer to the present time than the spirit’s 
					time of death (ex. within the last 10 years if the spirit died 20 years ago) or that has happened a 
					longer time before its birth than it has beem dead (ex. more than 20 years before its birth if the 
					spirit died 20 years ago). This is cumulative with all modifiers above</li>
				<li>+1 if it pertains to something that has happened either within the recent 10% of time since the spirit’s 
					time of death (ex. within the last 2 years if the spirit died 20 years ago) or that has happened more 
					than five times as long as it is dead before the time of its birth (ex. more than 100 years before its 
					birth if the spirit died 20 years ago). This is cumulative with all modifiers above</li>
				<li>+1 if it pertains to something that has happened either within the recent 1% of time since the spirit’s 
					time of death (ex. within the last 0.2 years if the spirit died 20 years ago) or that has happened more 
					than twenty times as long as it is dead before the time of its birth (ex. more than 400 years before 
					its birth if the spirit died 20 years ago). This is cumulative with all modifiers above</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Spirits will not (and possibly cannot) answer questions pertaining to the afterlife itself, including 
			questions as to whether they are well or unwell in the afterlife, or if they are acquainted to a certain 
			person’s spirit. Any such question is a wasted one. Spirits can only report about things that were known to a 
			person – any person, really – in life, provided this person is by now dead. If something is only known to 
			people who are still alive, no spirit can know it.</p>
