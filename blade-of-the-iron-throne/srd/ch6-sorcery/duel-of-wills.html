			<p class="h2">The Duel of Wills</p>
			<p>When two sorcerers battle, they don’t usually slug it out, Mystery against Mystery (though they may, of 
			course). Instead, they engage in a Duel of Wills. The Duel of Wills matches Sorcery Pool against Sorcery Pool, 
			similar to how melee combat matches Melee Pool against Melee Pool, and it has a similar structure of Exchanges 
			and Rounds.</p>
			
			<p>First of all, a Duel of Wills requires two willing participants. It's not possible for one sorcerer to 
			engage another in it against his will, and because of this, there is no possibility of surprise. Each sorcerer 
			uses a Spell Proficiency of his choice (usually his best) and announces this choice. There is no need for the 
			Sorcery Pools to derive from the same Mystery, and no need to stick to the same Mystery every Round. Penalties 
			from Taint and other sources fully apply to the Sorcery Pools during a Duel of Wills.</p>

			<p class="h4">Duel of Wills Overview</p>
			<p>One sorcerer is determined as the initial aggressor and one as defender. In some cases, these roles might be 
			obvious from the circumstances under which the Duel is entered, and in others, the participants might be in 
			agreement about who is the initial aggressor. If neither is the case, the roles are assigned as desired by the 
			sorcerer with the higher Sorcerous Priority, the higher Sorcery Pool if that is a tie, the higher Power 
			Attribute if this is a tie as well, and the higher Occultism Skill if tied again.</p>
			
			<p>The aggressor announces a sorcerous Offensive Maneuver and a number of dice from her Sorcery Pool assigned 
			to it, to which the defender reacts to by declaring a sorcerous Defensive Maneuver and assigning dice. Both 
			then pay any necessary Activation Costs for their chosen Maneuvers from their Sorcery Pools, roll their 
			assigned Maneuvers against their normal Casting Target Numbers for the Mystery used (from 6 to 8), applying any 
			modifiers from the Maneuver chosen, in an Opposed Check.</p>
			
			<p>If the aggressor is victorious, she retains initiative as aggressor, and there are additional effects as per 
			the Maneuver chosen. If the Defender is victorious, she may assume the part of the aggressor and possibly also 
			invoke additional effects as per her chosen Maneuver. In case of a tie, the aggressor retains this role.</p>
			
			<p>If the first Exchange does not result in an immediate decision, a second Exchange follows, for which the 
			remainder of the Sorcery Pool dice can be used, as per the melee rules. If this Exchange does still not yield 
			a decision, the Sorcery Pools refresh, and a new Round of Exchanges begin.</p>
			
			<p>The eventual loser of the duel is thrown to the ground under the onslaught of his opponent’s sorcerous 
			power, where he lies stunned for the next Combat Round (all Pools at 0 dice). In addition, his sorcerous 
			defences have been invaded and battered down by his opponent: For the remainder of the scene, he is at a +2 
			Target Number penalty to resist the victor’s sorceries, and is at +2 Casting Target Number penalty to affect 
			the victor with his own sorcery.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, he acquires 1 point of Taint. Depending on the actual Offensive Maneuver by which he was overcome, 
			the loser may also suffer physical damage on the Generic Damage Table. Armour Value never averts such injuries, 
			but Brawn soaks up some of it as normal.</p>
			
			<p>While crippling injuries are possible from a Duel of Wills, outright annihilation is rare. Wound Levels 1 
			through 4 are attained normally, by a result (Impact Rating – half Brawn) of 1 to 4 respectively. Wound Level 5 
			does however require a result of 6+, and Wound Level 6 of 8+.</p>
			
			<p>Under certain circumstances, a group of sorcerers may gang up on a single sorcerer, pooling their 
			ultramundane strength to best him. The circumstances under which this is possible and the mechanical aspects 
			of combining efforts are exactly as with Combining Sorcerous Efforts, as are the consequences of defeat (ex. 
			they are experienced by all to their full extent).</p>
			
			<p>The Duel of Wills is then handled normally, with the leader of each group of combatants making all decisions 
			and Checks. The only exception is that the Mystery used must remain the same throughout the contest. The 
			default physical aspect of a Duel of Wills is the two sorcerers staring at each other intently, maybe breaking 
			into sweat from the strain and swaying under the onslaught of the opponent’s will. For some settings it might 
			however be appropriate to be a bit gaudier. Lightning flickering between the sorcerers, gusts of wind tearing 
			at them, tongues of flame licking at them, vortexes of barely glimpsed demonic entities wavering between them 
			are only a small portion of the possibilities.</p>
			
			<p>Lastly, Duel of Will may, at the GM's discretion, be used between sorcerers and certain kinds of incorporeal 
			creatures, whom the Game Master would have to assign the equivalent of a Sorcery Pool. It can also be used for 
			battles between hostile beings they encounter while using the Scrying Mystery, though the latter under these 
			circumstances is at a decided Target Number advantage, being as they are on their home ground.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_SorcerousManeuvers">Sorcerous Maneuvers</p>
			<p>All Maneuvers have an Activation Cost that must be paid from the Sorcery Pool to utilize them. Some 
			Maneuvers are easier to use with Sorcery Pools based on certain Mysteries. Any such Mystery is listed as 
			“Favoured” with the Maneuver. <strong>Activation Costs are 2 dice less if the Sorcery Pool used is based on a 
			favoured Mystery, though never less than 0 dice, with the sole exception of the Endure defense, which may add 
			+2 dice to a Sorcery Pool if used with the Mending Mystery</strong>. Minimum Activation Costs are noted with 
			the Maneuvers.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3" id="P_OffensiveManeuvers">Offensive Maneuvers</p>
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Creep">Creep</p>
			<p><em>Activation: 2 (minimum 0)</em></p>
			<p><em>Favoured: Necromancy, Prophecy, Scrying</em></p>
			
			<p>Creep is an attempt to find a weak spot in the opponent’s psychic defences and to get an assault through. In 
			effect, this is a feint. The aggressor first declares another Offensive Maneuver, and only announces Creep once 
			the defender has committed dice to a Defensive Maneuver. The aggressor may then add dice from his uncommitted 
			Sorcery Pool to the already committed dice to the attack at the additional Activation Cost of 1 die per die 
			added. The remainder of the offence is then resolved as a Strike Maneuver.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Grind">Grind</p>
			<p><em>Activation: 2 (minimum 0)</em></p>
			<p><em>Favoured: Cursing</em></p>
			
			<p>Grind is for keeping up a steady assault to wear down an opponent’s defences. Assigned Sorcery Pool dice are 
			checked against the Casting Target Number, and Opposed by enemy’s chosen defence. If Grind is victorious, half 
			of the Quality of Success is added to the victor’s Sorcery Pool for the following Exchange, up to a maximum 
			bonus dice equal to the number of dice in her Sorcery Pool at the beginning of the following Exchange. Grind is 
			no way to win a Duel of Wills in itself; some other Offensive Maneuver is needed to finally deliver the 
			decisive blow.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Overpower">Overpower</p>
			<p><em>Activation: 6 (minimum 4)</em></p>
			<p><em>Favoured: Enslavement, Goety, Witchfire</em></p>
			
			<p>Overpower is the tactic used by a sorcerer sure of his own superiority; it is a brutal onslaught of eldritch 
			power, attempting to outright shatter the opponent’s defence. The assigned Sorcery Pool dice are checked 
			against the Casting Target Number, and Opposed by the enemy’s assigned defence dice. If the defender wins or 
			ties, he may immediately assume the part of aggressor.</p>
			
			<p>However, if the aggressor is victorious, he has broken through the opponent’s defences, and inflicts damage 
			of an Impact Rating equal to the total number of his Successes, not just those surpassing the defence 
			Successes.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_ATK_Strike">Strike</p>
			<p><em>Activation: 0 (minimum 0)</em></p>
			
			<p>Strike is the standard action of attacking with one’s sorcerous power. Assigned dice are checked against the 
			Casting Target Number, and are opposed by enemy’s chosen defence. If victorious, the victor may retain the 
			initiative, or may choose to inflict damage of an Impact Rating equal to the Quality of Success. If this Impact 
			Rating fails to inflict at least a level 1 wound, the attacker overestimated the power of his strike. The Duel 
			of Wills is still undecided, and the defender assumes the role of the aggressor.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h3" id="P_DefensiveManeuvers">Defensive Maneuvers</p>
			<p class="h4" id="P_DEF_Counterstroke">Counterstroke</p>
			<p><em>Activation: 3 (minimum 1)</em></p>
			<p><em>Favoured: Cursing</em></p>
			
			<p>The finicky and difficult tactic of turning the opponent’s power against herself. Defence dice are assigned 
			and checked as normal, with a tie having the usual result of the aggressor retaining this role.</p>
			
			<p>If the defender surpasses the attacker’s number of Successes, she immediately becomes the aggressor and 
			attacks with a Strike on the very next Exchange (no choice here). She can assign as many dice from her Sorcery 
			Pool as she wants to this Strike, and will have additional bonus dice equal to the previous’ aggressor’s number 
			of Successes on the attack successfully defended against.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_DEF_Deflect">Deflect</p>
			<p><em>Activation: 0 (minimum 0)</em></p>
			
			<p>The standard tactic of deflecting the opponent’s attack. If the number of Successes from the assigned 
			Sorcery Pool checked against the Casting Target Number equals the aggressor’s attack Successes, the attack was 
			deflected. If it exceeds them, the defender may assume the mantle of aggressor.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_DEF_Endure">Endure</p>
			<p><em>Activation: 0 (minimum -2)</em></p>
			<p><em>Favoured: Mending (including Pain), Necromancy</em></p>
			
			<p>The tactic of hunkering down and taking everything the opponent throws at you in the hope that he will wear 
			himself out. If the defence is successful, no matter to what degree, the defender may not assume the role of 
			aggressor (see the sole exception below.) However, the aggressor loses dice from his Sorcery Pool equal to half 
			the number of Successes on his attack for his next Exchange; the successful defender loses half as many dice as 
			the aggressor, though always less than him (ex. if the aggressor loses 1 die, the defender loses none).</p>
			
			<p>If this results in the next Exchange starting with the current aggressor’s Sorcery Pool depleted, and the 
			defender still retaining dice in his Sorcery Pool, the latter may assume the part of aggressor.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_DEF_Evade">Evade</p>
			<p><em>Activation: 0 (minimum 0)</em></p>
			<p><em>Favoured: Prophecy</em></p>
			
			<p>The tactic of getting the hell out of the fight, evading is only possible if the sorcerer that wants to 
			utilize it didn't use an Offensive Maneuver in the immediately preceding Exchange; neither can this Maneuver be 
			used on a confrontation’s very first Exchange. The assigned defence dice are checked against the Casting Target 
			Number with a –2 bonus. If they tie the attack dice’s Successes, the Duel of Will is ended. It does, however, 
			entail acknowledgement of defeat and inferiority.</p>
			
			<p>For the remainder of the scene, the sorcerer ending a Duel of Wits by means of Evade suffers a Casting 
			Target Number penalty of +1 to affect his opponent with any sorcery, and the opponent affects him with a 
			Casting Target number bonus of –1.</p>
