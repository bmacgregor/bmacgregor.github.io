			<p class="h2">Sorcery</p>
			<p>Sorcery is not an academic, scholarly pursuit. Its practitioners don't theorize, engage in complicated 
			experiments, conduct research into sorcery’s underlying principles, study ways to apply them to novel uses.</p>
			
			<p>The inner workings of sorcery are unknowable, and even the greatest sorcerers can only guess at why and how 
			their invocations work. While sorcerers in <em>Blade</em> may or may not be erudite, bookish types, they are not 
			scientists. After all, sorcery isn't a science; it's a strange, unknowable force of uncertain origin, an origin 
			that is usually somehow transmundane. It isn't just another natural force, like gravity or magnetism. Instead, 
			a degree of “outsideness” is always inherent to it.</p>

			<p class="h4">Sorcery Overview</p>
			<p>Sorcerers certainly have ideas where the power they manipulate derives from, but they can never be certain. 
			In one setting, it may come from something between the stars, in another, it might be channelled from some 
			eldritch and alien deity, or many other things. It is, however, never a beneficent or wholesome power, and is 
			likely impersonal.</p>
			
			<p>Those beings that impart and grant sorcerous power always have an agenda of their own; an agenda that will 
			often be unfathomable, especially if it is derived from contact with supernatural, godlike beings.</p>
			
			<p>This agenda is - at best - totally alien and entirely indifferent to human beings and their plight. At worst, 
			it's inimical to humanity. The former might be true in cases where sorcery is perceived as a strange power from 
			beyond the limits of this universe, the latter in cases where it is channelled from some sinister deity. In the 
			common instance, where sorcery is derived from dealings with demonic gods, sorcerers are usually worshippers or 
			cultists of such deities, or have formed pacts with them. This doesn't mean that such sorcerers actually have 
			to be devout – for many, it will be a pact, where they further a demonic being’s agenda in return for receiving 
			other-worldly powers.</p>
			
			<p>This brings us to the topic of how sorcery is learned. The fantasy trope of the apprenticeship to a sorcerer 
			exists in <em>Blade</em>, but it's not the sole, and perhaps not the most common way of acquiring sorcerous 
			knowledge. Alongside it always exists the possibility of approaching a sorcerous deity – provided such exists 
			in the setting – and forging a pact with it to receive sorcerous knowledge in return for whatever such an 
			unfathomable and unwholesome entity might require of a mere human. Only the most driven will head down such a 
			path, and it is usually strength of will and intensity of personality that characterise a sorcerer in 
			<em>Blade</em>, rather than intelligence and erudition.</p>
			
			<p>Ultimately, sorcery means always dealing with strange, alien, and inimical powers, whether personal, or 
			detached. As it is no science, it rarely attracts practitioners who are in it for the intellectual challenge 
			offered, though it sometimes attracts curious individuals of a philosophical bent. Overwhelmingly, those 
			attracted to sorcery are in it for sheer power. Much more often than scientists, sorcerers will be priests, 
			fanatical, sacrificial dagger wielding cultists of a god of darkness, or calculating schemers trying to get the 
			most out of their sinister patron for the least amount of their own involvement, perhaps even playing the 
			dangerous game of playing one patron against another. Whomever they are, however, they are never detached, 
			ivory-tower scholars in pointy hats.</p>
			
			<p>Because of this, sorcery in <em>Blade</em> is the manipulation of ultramundane powers that are at best alien, 
			and at worst, hostile towards humanity. In working with sorcery, one’s body and soul are exposed to these 
			inimical powers.</p>
			
			<p>The wise sorcerer will refrain from overreaching himself, and take good care not to open his soul’s portals 
			too far to the influences from beyond, lest he become tainted with them.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Mechanics">The Mechanics of Sorcery</p>
			<p>Sorcery rests on three legs. First, there are the six Lesser Mysteries, of which the occasional hedge 
			wizard, shaman, or cultist may know one or two. Then there are the two Greater Mysteries; powerful magics that 
			are the sole domain of dedicated sorcerers. Finally, there are the Arcane Secrets - mythical feats of great 
			magic - the stuff of sorcerous legends known to only the very greatest of sorcerers.</p>
			
			<p>How Arcane Secrets are learned is a special case, explained later, but Lesser and Greater Mysteries are 
			learned in a fashion similar to weapon Proficiencies. At Character creation, ratings in Mysteries are bought 
			with points from the Proficiency priority. As with Attributes and Skills, the maximum rating that can be 
			attained in any Mystery is 8, with a rating of 9 allowed in a single Mystery, purchased through the course of 
			play.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_SorceryPool">The Sorcery Pool</p>
			<p>The Mystery's proficiency score makes up one half of the Sorcery Pool. The other half is Power, the 
			sorcerer’s innate ability to create magic.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Power = (Sagacity + Tenacity + Brawn + Bonus) / 3</strong></p>
			
			<p>The Bonus is equal to the number of Mysteries the sorcerer is proficient in, but it can <em>never be higher 
			than the rating of the Mystery she is most proficient in</em>.</p>
			
			<p>The total Sorcery Pool available for any sorcerous action is equal to Power + Mystery Proficiency. Sorcery 
			Pool dice are split into two parts, with a minimum of 1 die in each. The first of these parts is to work the 
			sorcery; to make the Casting Check. The second part is used to contain the eldritch powers invoked; to make a 
			Containment Check.</p>
			
			<p>The base Target Numbers of these Checks vary with the Sorcery Priority the Character is built on.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Mysteriarch (A Priority) : Target Number 6</li>
				<li>Sorcerer (B Priority) : Target Number 7</li>
				<li>Dabbler (C Priority) : Target Number 8</li>								
			</ul>
			
			<p>First, the Mystery (or spell) is cast. To achieve the desired effect, Sorcery Pool dice are checked against 
			the appropriate Target Number, based on the Character's Priority level. Depending on the sorcery, this Casting 
			Check may be an Opposed one; for specifics, see the various Mysteries and Arcane Secrets. One Success will 
			usually be sufficient to achieve some kind of effect, but more may be required for the desired magnitude of 
			effect. Details on this can also be found within the description of the various Mysteries and Arcane Secrets.</p>
			
			<p>Once the Check for casting the spell is made, the remaining, allotted dice in the Sorcery Pool are used to 
			<strong>contain the effect</strong>. This Containment Check is made against a Target Number of 7, and requires 
			<em>at least as many Successes as on the Casting Check to fully contain the sorcerous energies</em>. For every 
			Success short, the sorcerer accumulates one point of Taint. If the Containment Check does not yield at least 
			half as many Successes as the Casting Check, the effect is cast uncontained. In such cases, the sorcery takes 
			effect as intended, but also turns against the sorcerer. This takes the form of a Complication to be affected by 
			the Game Master at the earliest opportunity. Often, this will be a side-effect of the sorcery turning against 
			the sorcerer or against someone he does not wish ensorcelled, but it can also take the form of entirely mundane 
			unpleasantries.</p>
			
			<p>Optionally, any uncontained effect (ex. a Containment Check that yields less than half the Successes of the 
			Casting Check) can also cause the sorcerer physical damage from eldritch energies turning against herself. If 
			this rule is used, inflict a level 1 wound from the Generic Damage Table on the sorcerer every time one of her 
			effects is uncontained, or a level 2 wound if the Containment Check doesn’t yield a single Success.</p>
			
			<p>Depending on the setting, this may manifest as withering, bleeding, scorching, or another form of generic 
			damage that cannot be negated by use of the <em>It’s Only a Scratch</em> mechanic.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Taint">Taint</p>
			<p>In working magic, the sorcerer opens himself up to alien, transmundane powers. If he isn't careful, these 
			powers will leave their mark on him. This metaphysical stench is called Taint.</p>
			
			<p>Uncontained sorcery inflicts Taint on the sorcerer; one point for every corresponding uncontained success. 
			Taint interferes with the working of further sorcery, and imparts an aura of sinister otherworldliness to the 
			Character which is disturbing to man and beast alike. Depending on the severity of a Character’s current 
			Taint, dice are subtracted from her Sorcery Pool, and additional Successes are required on all Checks for 
			non-hostile interaction with both beast and men, as per the Taint Effect Table.</p>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_TaintEffects">Taint Effects</p>
			<table class="table table-striped table-hover" id="TBL_TaintEffects">
				<thead>
					<th>Taint</th>
					<th>Sorcery Pool Penalty</th>

			<p>The additional Successes required for successful interaction do not apply to interaction with sorcerous 
			creatures and animals that have a reputation in the setting as being sorcerous themselves (ex. cats, ravens, 
			toads, etc.), but does apply to interaction with other sorcerers. Taint fades over time. Every 12 hours, at 
			concrete, setting-specific times (ex. moonrise, sunset, midnight, etc.), Taint is reduced by 1, provided no 
			new Taint was acquired during the last 12 hours. Taint can also be reduced in various ways:</p>
			
			<p>Characters with a faith-related Passion Attribute can attempt to reduce their current Taint by praying and 
			offering up a sacrifice at an appropriately consecrated locale. After the sacrifice, the faith-related Passion 
			is checked against a Target Number of 7, with the number of Successes deducted from the current Taint rating. 
			Only a single sacrifice is possible per week.</p>
			
			<p>Alternatively, the sorcerer can conduct a ritual of purification, which might also take the form of some 
			nefarious rite in the case of sorcerers invoking some supernatural patron for their power. Such a ritual 
			requires about 12 hours, during which nothing else can be done, and will - depending on the setting and the 
			culture - involve chanting, meditation, drug-induced trances, and the like. After the ritual is conducted, the 
			sorcerer checks Power against a Target Number of 7, with every Success reducing his current Taint by 1 point.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, Taint can also reduce itself in a backlash. For this to occur the sorcerer’s current Taint must at 
			least be equal to her Heart, and she must either acquire at least another 3 points of Taint at once, or cast 
			an uncontained sorcery (ex. Containment Successes equalling less than half of her Casting Successes). In such a 
			case, the Taint discharges itself, usually in the guise of a curse (see the Cursing Mystery). This discharge 
			cuts the sorcerer’s Taint rating in half (again, round up fractions of 0.50 and above), but the sorcerer 
			becomes victim of a curse with a curse rating equal to the number of Taint points that were lost in the 
			discharge.</p>
			
			<p>In some settings it might be more fitting to have the Taint backlash assume the form of some temporary 
			physical affliction like a twisted limb, a bulging eye, scales instead of skin, or a third eye popping up in 
			some conspicuous area of the body, or anything else that fits the flavour of sorcery in the setting. Such an 
			affliction will have the game effects of requiring 1 or more additional Successes on one or more broad types 
			of action (social interaction, physical exertion, mental exercises, etc.). Each penalty of 1 imparted will 
			reduce the curse rating from the Taint backlash by 1. No more than half the original curse rating may be  
			converted.</p>
			
			<p>These afflictions last until the curse from the Taint discharge has run its course and fades. In some 
			settings, it might be desirable to have some minor and non-debilitating trace of the afflictions remain, like a 
			scar from a wound.</p>
			
			<p>If the group feels that even more gruesome additional consequences are appropriate for their setting, they 
			might decide that any Taint backlash of a certain magnitude immediately deducts one point from the sorcerer’s 
			Heart Attribute, only to be regained through normal Character development mechanics.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, and independent of any additional Taint mechanics, if the optional rule about insufficient 
			containment causing damage is used, any damage suffered from an uncontained sorcery that also causes a Taint 
			backlash is increased by 1 level (to a theoretical maximum of 3).</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_CombiningSorcerousEfforts">Combining Sorcerous Efforts</p>
			<p>In <em>Blade</em>, sorcerers are a rare commodity, most especially those knowing more than one or two 
			Lesser Mysteries. Thus, there will seldom be a situation when several sorcerers combine their arcane powers. 
			When they do, it is an absolute necessity for the combination of such efforts that the cooperating sorcerers 
			belong to the same cult, coven, or sorcerous order. >Merely practicing sorcery of the same general cultural 
			tradition is not enough. Actual membership in some kind of shared sorcerous brotherhood is indispensable. If 
			this prerequisite is met - while it is not necessary that every sorcerer partaking in this pooling of power 
			know the particular Mystery being used - it is beneficial.</p>
			
			<p>The sorcerer with the highest rating in the Mystery being attempted (not the sorcerer with the largest 
			Sorcery Pool), heads the effort, and his pool is the one modified. Dice from each participating sorcerer are 
			cumulatively added to his Sorcery Pool as follows:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>+1 to the caster’s pool if the contributor knows a Lesser Mystery</li>
				<li>+1 to the caster’s pool if the contributor knows more than three Lesser Mysteries</li>
				<li>+1 to the caster’s pool if the contributor knows a Greater Mystery</li>
				<li>+1 to the caster’s pool if the contributor knows two Greater Mysteries</li>
				<li>+1 to the caster’s pool if the contributor knows any Arcane Secrets</li>
				<li>-1 to the caster’s pool if a Lesser Mystery is being cast that is unknown to the contributor</li>
				<li>-2 to the caster’s pool if a Greater Mystery or Arcane Secret are being cast that is unknown to the 
				contributor</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The downside of such combined sorcerous efforts is that its consequences are not merely confined to the 
			primary caster, but afflict every participant in full. This includes both Taint and any other negative effects 
			resulting from insufficiently successful Containment Checks – they afflict every participating sorcerer in 
			their entirety.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_AffectingMultipleTargets">Affecting Multiple Targets</p>
			<p>Sorcerers can affect more than one victim at once with a single application of the Cursing, Enslavement, and 
			Mending Mysteries. The targets affected must all constitute a group, either in the sense of their physical 
			proximity (with no non-members of the group interspersed between them), or else in another, clearly delineated 
			sense. For example, a sorcerer could affect all present redheads, or eunuchs, or priests, even if those are 
			mixed into a larger group.</p>
			
			<p>Casting and Containment Checks are made as usual, but 1 Casting Success is discarded for every target after 
			the first. The remaining Casting Successes are Opposed as by the mechanics for the Mystery used, but only once, 
			by the single target with the best chances to succeed at resisting the Mystery. The outcome of this single 
			Check determines whether the sorcery overcomes the resistance of all targets; if it fails, all targets are 
			affected, if it is successful, no target is affected.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_AffectMultipleTargets">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: A sorcerer uses Pain against three guardsmen charging him. He achieves 6 
				Casting Successes, of which 2 are discarded for the two additional targets. The guardsmen with the best TY 
				Checks this Attribute to oppose the 4 Casting Successes. If he achieves 4 or more Successes, no guardsman 
				is affected; if he achieves less than 4 Successes, all three guardsmen suffer Pain 12.</p>
				
				<p>The Witchfire Mystery can also be used against several targets at once, with the same mechanic of 
				discarding Casting Successes for additional targets. The reduced number of Casting Successes are used both 
				for damage calculation and for the attack rolls. Unlike with the other Mysteries, Checks to hit and avoid 
				the Witchfire attack are made individually, for every target and by every target.</em></p>
