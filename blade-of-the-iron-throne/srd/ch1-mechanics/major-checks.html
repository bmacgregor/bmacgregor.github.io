			<p class="h2">Dice Types Used</p>
			<p>Most of the time in gaming, you don’t use a rule; you make a ruling. The Players can describe any action 
			without needing to look at a Character sheet to see if they can do it. The Game Master, in turn, uses common 
			sense to decide what happens or rolls a die only if she thinks there’s some random element involved. When 
			needed, <em>Blade</em> uses two types of dice during play, <strong>twelve-sided dice</strong> (d12) and 
			<strong>six-sided dice</strong> (d6). References throughout this book refer to twelve-sided dice unless 
			otherwise noted.</p>

			<p class="h4">Major Checks</p>
			<p>In <em>Blade</em>, Checks are made by rolling an appropriate number of dice for the Attribute or Skill level 
			being tested against a fixed Target Number (or TN) of seven. The number of successes needed for both Attribute 
			and Skill Checks are drawn from the following table.</p>
				
			<div class="panel-body" id="TBL_SuccessesNeeded">

			<p>Only dice rolled that meet or exceed the Target Number are successful. With the exception of Proficiency and 
			Mystery Checks, all Checks are made against a Target Number of seven, unless modified by Assets. Quality of 
			Success may also denote an action’s degree of success as indicated in the following table.</p>

			<p>While only one success is normally needed for an action to be successful, some actions at the GM’s 
			discretion may be tasked with additional success requirements. One example could be a Player Character 
			attempting to pick a lock while pressed for time:</p>
		
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Exaple_SuccessRequirements">
				<p><em><strong>GM: </strong>You want to pick this lock? That would normally be only Average, but to do it 
				in time is Challenging. You’re going to need two successes. Getting no successes will mean things get 
				complicated! (See the section on <a href="#P_Complications">Complications</a> later in this 
				chapter)</em></p>
				
				<p><em><strong>Player: </strong>Damn! I don’t have Lock Picking as a skill! Can I try it using that 
				lock-pick Otho gave me?</em></p>
				
				<p><em><strong>GM: </strong>Sure - but it’ll be tougher since you don’t know what you’re doing. Now you’re 
				going to need four successes. And any result of two or less successes will earn you a Complication.</em></p>
				
				<p>In this example one success would normally achieve the task (opening the lock), but an additional 
				success is required to achieve the intended result (opening it before something else happens), for a total 
				of two successes.</p>
			</div>
		
			<br/>
		
			<p<strong>Attempting a task as an Attribute Check instead of a Skill Check<em>doubles</em> the number of 
			successes needed</strong>. <em>Blade</em> follows the idea that one action requires one Check. There are three 
			basic types of Checks:</p>
		
			<div class="panel-body" id="P_AttributeChecks">
				<p class="h4">Attribute Checks</p>
				
				<p><strong>Attribute Checks</strong> are made with a die pool derived from an Attribute level. They 
				represent tasks attempted with one’s natural, inborn ability - one’s talent - with abilities one has picked 
				up along the way without formal training.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="panel-body" id="P_SkillChecks">
				<p class="h4">Skill Checks</p>
				<p><strong>Skill Checks</strong> are tests made with a die pool derived from a Skill level. Skills reflect 
				a Character’s aptitude in a trained, acquired pursuit. The degree of capability a Character can attain 
				through training is limited by his talent for it. <strong>Wwhen using a Skill, a Character’s Skill dice 
				pool may never equal or exceed twice the value of the Attribute that would be most applicable for 
				the task attempted</strong>.</p>
				
				<p>For example, a Character with a Cunning of three means that he can use no more than five dice from the 
				Lock Picking Skill in any situation.</p>
				
				<p>Conversely, Characters unskilled in a particular discipline work at a disadvantage compared to their 
				skilled counterparts. They may attempt Checks by using the its corresponding Attribute, but <strong>require 
				twice as many successes as someone who knows the Skill</strong>.</p>
				
				<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_SkillCheck">
					<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho wants to accomplish a task requiring the Animal Ken Skill, but is 
					untrained in it. He has a Heart of six, and therefore may use it for the Check instead. If someone 
					skilled in Animal Ken would normally need two  successes to succeed at a specific Animal Ken Check, 
					Otho would instead need four.</em></p>
				</div>
					
					<br/>
					
					<p>Skill levels are generally rated as per the following table.</p>
							
					<div class="panel-body" id="TBL_SkillLevels">
						<p class="h4">Skill Levels</p>
						<table class="table table-striped table-hover">
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>Zero</td>
								<td>Default for untrained characters</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>One</td>
								<td>Beginner; Most students</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Two</td>
								<td>Apprentice; Growing in skill</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Three - Four</td>
								<td>Journeyman; Trained professionals</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Five - Seven</td>
								<td>Adept; Skilled and respected veterans</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Eight - Nine</td>
								<td>Master; Well-known and sought after</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
						</table>
					</div>
			</div>
				
			<div class="panel-body">				
				<p>Attribute and Skill values range from one to eight, with <em>one</em> Skill and Attribute each at a 
				maximum level of nine <strong>per Player or NPC. No two Characters may have a score of nine in the same 
				Attribute or Skill</strong>. NPCs are not bound by this stricture and may have the same Skill or Attribute 
				at level nine that his Player counterpart enjoys, however, <em>for each Attribute or Skill, there may only 
				be a single NPC per campaign who has this Attribute or Skill at level nine. If this NPC dies or otherwise 
				leaves the campaign, he may not be replaced by another NPC with a score of nine in that Attribute 
				or Skill for the rest of the campaign.</em></p>
				
				<p>Skill Check Challenge Levels should always frame the task in terms of how hard it is for someone who 
				does it all the time. They are invariably rolled against a Target Number seven (TN7), unless modified by 
				an Asset.</p>
				
				<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_HardSkillCheck">			
					<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Having gained admission to the Radja’s dinner ball, Otho prowls the 
					halls in search for his intended pickpocket victim. The GM advises that the society vultures are 
					unusually acerbic tonight and that Otho will have to bluff his way through several social encounters 
					before locating the victim. He declares drawing no attention whatsoever to him a Challenging (two 
					successes needed) feat of Etiquette.</em></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="panel-body" id="P_ProficiencyChecks">
				<p class="h4">Proficiency Checks</p>
				<p><strong>Proficiency Checks</strong> are made with a dice pool calculated from several contributing 
				scores, and are done by rolling any number of dice drawn from the appropriate pool (either the Melee, 
				Archery, or Sorcery Pools, respectively) against Target Numbers that frequently differ from the usual 
				Target Number of seven. They are more fully explained in chapters <a href="../ch4 Melee/Home.html">four 
				(Combat)</a> and <a href="../ch6 Sorcery/Home.html">six (Sorcery)</a>.</p>
			</div>
					
			<div class="panel-body" id="P_OpposedChecks">
				<p class="h4">Opposed Checks</p>
				<p><strong>Opposed Checks</strong> are made whenever two Characters or forces match each other for 
				supremacy. Examples include attacking an opponent, detecting an ambush, or slipping past a patrol.</p>
				
				<p>All manner of Checks may be tested against any other, with one Player possibly attempting a Skill Check, 
				while her opponent rolls an Attribute Check in opposition. With Opposed Checks, both participants roll 
				against Target Number seven. The number of successes of the participant with the <em>smaller</em> number of 
				successes are subtracted from the other participant’s, leaving the latter as the winner with a Quality of 
				Success as an indicator of the general degree of victory.</p>
				
				<p>For example, if Otho is trying to lie to a Street Thug, both roll their Falsehood skill against a Target
				Number of seven.  Otho rolls a 12, 8, 7, and 4 for a total of three successes, while the Thug rolls a 10, 3, 
				and a 2, achieving one success.  The Thug's successes are then subtratced from Otho's (3 - 1) leaving
				Otho with a final result - or Quality of Success - of two.</p>
				
				<p>If an Opposed Skill Check is called for and one party lacks the required Skill, he may substitute 
				the most appropriate Attribute as normal, but must compare his result to twice the number of successes of 
				his opponent.</p>
				
				<p>Ties are counted as a success for the party who wants to maintain the status quo. In picking somebody’s 
				pockets, a tie would result in a failure for the thief. In attempting to avoid detection by a guard, a tie 
				would keep the thief hidden.</p>
				
				<p>A Quality of Success of one will always achieve the desired task. If the Game Master deems this too easy 
				(thinking that additional factors would make the task harder to achieve for one than the other party) he is 
				advised not to call for an Opposed Check, but for a straight-forward (but difficult) Attribute or Skill 
				Check instead.</p>
				
				<p>If an Opposed Check matches one Character against several others at the same time, a single roll is 
				made for every Character involved. The solitary character compares his result to each opponent’s roll. 
				For example, if a thief tries to sneak past two soldiers standing guard, one roll is made for the thief and 
				one for every soldier. The thief’s result is then compared separately to both results, for two Qualities of 
				Success scores.</p>
				
				<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_MultipleOpponents">
					<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho makes his move at the ball and invites a rich old dowager (and her 
					beautiful diamond necklace!) to dance. As they swirl about the dance floor he directs her to a somewhat 
					unobserved spot and tries to remove the necklace. An Opposed Check with two antagonists is now called 
					for: The guard closest to the pair makes a Check using his Sagacity (4) Attribute, testing his powers of 
					observation, and the dowager checks using her Sagacity (3) Attribute, to determine if she is aware of 
					the necklace being removed.</em></p>
					
					<p>Otho makes a single Check using Pick Pockets (6) against both opponents. Otho needs to tie the 
					guard’s result to pocket the necklace unobserved by the guard (the status quo being that the guard 
					notices nothing special), but he needs to trump the dowager’s successes to filch the necklace (the 
					status quo being that she has it).</p>
					
					<p><em>Unluckily, Otho achieves a single successes, the guard rolls one success, and the dowager rolls a 
					somewhat lucky two successes. While the guard would not have noticed anything out of the ordinary, 
					the dowager feels Otho’s groping fingers and raises a ruckus, leaving Otho to bluff his way out of a 
					tight spot.</em></p>
