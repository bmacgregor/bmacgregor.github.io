			<p class="h2">What is a Role Playing Game?</p>
			<p>Role playing is about being creative and having fun. It involves getting together with friends to write a 
			story, perhaps joining around a campfire or a dining room table to spin some tall tales. Role Playing Games 
			(RPGs) are stories in which you create one of the main characters and the story around that character. The rest 
			of the Players create stories around their own characters. The Game Master (or more simply, GM) brings those 
			stories together.</p>

			<p class="h3">What is a Role-playing Game? (Continued)</p>
			<p>The Game Master can be thought of as the director of the story. In most RPGs, the GM will - with input from 
			you, if you desire to give any - describe a world or setting. You and your friends will play the protagonists
			of this world, guiding your Characters through the story that you create. Each person plays a different 
			Character, and each Character interacts with each of the other Characters. Role playing, in this sense, is very 
			much play-acting in the mind. You imagine what the Game Master describes. Then you imagine your Character’s 
			response to that situation, and describe that to the GM and the other Players. They, in turn, do the same with 
			their Characters.</p>
			
			<p>In most games – board games, card games, and dice games – there is a clearly defined way to win and a 
			clearly defined way to lose. Typically, winning is the goal of the game. In Role playing games, the concepts 
			of “winning” and “losing” do not exist. Your goal as a Player is to help create a story and to have fun. You 
			may give your Character other goals, but the success of your Character does not determine any sense of 
			winning or losing.</p>
			
			<p>Like life, it’s not so much whether you win or lose, but how you play the game. <em>That’s all well and good,
			</em>you say, <em>but what actually goes on? What do these “Characters” do?</em> Most of the time, Characters 
			are involved in adventures; adventures of the type that are immortalized in adventure movies and serial novels. 
			In one game, the Characters might be a group of secret agents trying to save the world from nuclear destruction.
			In another, you might play a rebel force trying to overthrow an evil star-spanning empire. You might play a 
			group of warriors in eleventh century Europe, or King Arthur’s knights, or Superman, or Batman, or an original 
			Character of your own creation - in any world you choose. Like all games and many RPGs, <em>Blade of the Iron 
			Throne</em> involves elements of chance, skill, and strategy. These three elements are tightly related.</p>

			<p class="h3">What kind of RPG is <em>Blade of the Iron Throne?</em></p>
			<p><em>Blade of the Iron Throne</em> (hereafter <em>Blade</em>) is an amalgamation of a number of different 
			game system mechanics; a blend of old and new gaming sensibilities. It's steeped in tales of Sword & Sorcery 
			(or S&S) fiction.</p>
			
			<p>Sword & Sorcery is a sub-genre of fantasy fiction, taking its name from the sword-slinging adventurers who 
			generally make up the genre’s protagonists, and the sorcery-using characters who are often the villains or 
			antagonists. Common to Sword & Sorcery stories is the mindset of the main character. The Sword & Sorcery hero 
			is always a man (or woman) of action. He may be very intelligent and given to brooding and pondering (eg. Kull 
			of Valusia), but when a situation requires a response, he does not hesitate or procrastinate endlessly. 
			<strong>He acts</strong>.</p>
			
			<p>In Sword & Sorcery books, the world is a harsh place. People’s lives are ruined or ended left and right. 
			To survive in this harsh world, the Protagonist has to display a fair degree of harshness herself. However, a 
			defining characteristic of Sword & Sorcery is that the heroes (even the borderlie evil ones) stick to an 
			unofficial and informal code; one that does not allow him to cross the line and treat friends and companions
			unfairly. People he has shared danger with, and even respected enemies <em>matter</em> to the hero. Indeed, 
			some he treats with consideration and kindness. The most vicious Sword & Sorcery hero adheres to this code; 
			it's what separates him from the villains. A Sword & Sorcery villain will cross the line - that’s what makes 
			him a villain.</p>

			information on running a Sword & Sorcery campaign using <strong>Blade</strong>.)</em></p>
