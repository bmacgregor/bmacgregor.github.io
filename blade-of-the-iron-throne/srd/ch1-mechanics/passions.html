			<p>All Characters possess four Passion Attributes, or for short, Passions, each having a <strong>maximum 
			value of five points</strong>. In addition, each Character has a special fixed Passion Attribute known 
			as <em>Drama</em>.</p>
				
			<p>Quite simply, Passion Attributes give your Character the will, drive, and determination to succeed when 
			the going gets tough.</p>

				<p class="h4">How They Work</p>
				<p>If your Character is involved in a situation where he is struggling to defend, protect, further, or 
				foster a Passion Attribute, that Passion gives its numerical value as extra dice added to the roll. For 
				Attribute or Skill Checks, when one or more Passion potentially apply, the highest applicable Passion 
				Attribute's value will be added to the appropriate dice pool for the Check.</p>
				
				<p>For example, if you decide that one of your Passions is to <em>Find all six artifacts of the first 
				Emperor</em>, and you find an ancient rune clue in a tomb you believe has one of the artifacts, then the 
				Game Master might let you add your applicable Passion Attribute's equivalent dice value to your roll to 
				read the rune.</p>
				
				<p>In Combat, Passion Attributes work in a similar manner. However, instead the highest applicable Passion 
				adding its value to every roll, while in combat, <strong>apply the highest applicable Passion Attribute, 
				plus an extra die for every other applicable Passion Attribute, regardless of its current rating, as a 
				bonus to the character’s Melee, Archery, and Sorcery Pools</strong>. All Passion Attributes should be 
				collectively determined before play begins, with thought given to the harmony of the varied goals of all 
				players participating in the session. Remember, Passion Attributes let you, <em>the Players</em>, 
				collectively tell the Game Master exactly what <em>you</em> want the game to be about.</p>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<p class="h4">I Have To Make Them up Myself?</p>
				<p>Yes, you do. This is understandably daunting, yet the most exciting task of Character Creation. 
				Regardless of whatever else is written on that sheet, no matter how strong or weak the Characters' 
				other Attributes, combat skills, magical aptitude, or skills are, nothing is more influential to that 
				Character than those four lines.</p>
				
				<p>While your four Passion Attributes define the general story being told, the <em>Drama Passion</em> fine 
				tunes the result. Do you want to develop a love interest with the noblewoman you just met? Spend a Drama 
				point! Do you need a convenient hay wagon to land in when leaping from a window? Spend a Drama point! Drama 
				points can be used in most situations and are earned by roleplaying your character well.</p>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<p class="h4">Passions also advance my Character?</p>
				<p>Yes, they do. Any time you role play and act on one of your Passion Attributes, the Game Master may 
				reward your role playing with a Passion Attribute point. By acting on a Passion, it shows that it means 
				something to your Character. As an aside, the numerical value of any Passion Attribute does not represent 
				its importance to your Character or its priority over your other Passion Attributes; that's determined by 
				your role playing alone, and merely defines which Passion is currently the focus of you, the Player.</p>
				
				<p>So, by playing your Passion Attribute’s, they increase. Now, does the Game Master keep a tally of what 
				you did during a session, and then dole points out at the end?</p>
				
				<p>No! He <em>immediately</em> awards you with a point. The game is a dynamic field, where emotions and 
				drama fluctuate naturally, instead of waiting for the pause between ‘episodes.’</p>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<p class="h4">Wait - If They get Awarded at Any Time...</p>
				<p>That’s right! You can <em>spend them</em> at any time. Suddenly do you wish you were a bit stronger, 
				or maybe a bit more nimble of mind? Then spend the points mid game, and it is so. See 
				<a href="../ch2 Characters/Home.html">Chapter Two - Characters</a>, and 
				<a href="../ch3 Training/Home.html">Chapter Three - Training</a> for more information on spending Passion 
				points.</p>

				<p class="h4" id="P_CreatingPassionAttributes">Creating Passion Attributes</p>
				<p>The scope of a Passion Attribute can be defined as either broad, narrow, or intermediate.</p>
				
				<p>Assuming a player has the vague notion that he would like to have a series of adventures about his 
				Character's attempts to become ruler of a nation, a Passion Attribute of <em>Become King by My Own Hand</em> 
				could be considered a Passion Attribute with a broad scope. The same player, envisioning that his Character’s 
				first intermediate step on his rise to the throne will be gaining political influence as protegé of the 
				King’s current Grand Vizier might instead formulate a Passion Attribute of <em>Win the Trust of the Grand 
				Vizier</em>. This could be considered a Passion Attribute of narrow scope. An intermediate position would be 
				if the Player determines that his Character's rise to the throne is not to be by force, but by political 
				means, which he leaves as of yet undefined, formulating a Passion Attribute of <em>Amass Political 
				Influence</em> — an intermediate Passion Attribute.</p>
				
				<p>Each of these three scopes have their own advantages and disadvanatges.</p>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<p class="h4">Broad Passion Attributes</p>
				<p>The advantage of a broad Passion Attribute like <em>Become King by My Own Hand</em> is that the Passion 
				Attribute can conceivably be considered to be engaged by many different scenarios and situations. Any 
				activity that can be construed as bringing the Character closer to her distant goal, or even just in a 
				position to better pursue this goal, can be considered to activate the Passion Attribute. This means that 
				the Player will often have the mechanical benfit of the Passion Attribute. It also makes it easy for the GM 
				to present the Player with situations and scenes where the Passion will be engaged.</p>
				
				<p>The disadvantage of the broad Passion lies in its fuzziness. If you are playing a Character who still has 
				far to go to assume the mantle of kingship, a broad Passion Attribute like <em>Become King by My Own Hand</em> 
				doesn't really tell the Game Master much about what adventures the Player would like to have <strong>right 
				now</strong>. A Character who’s a penniless, unconnected vagabond with such a Passion Attribute can hardly be 
				presented with an opening to become King right away. While a broad Passion  will often be activated, it tells 
				the GM little about what the Player would like to have adventures about, and the Player will thus find 
				himself frequently at the fringes of scenarios that are tailored more closely to Players who communicated 
				their wishes in a narrow frame and thus, will appear in a supporting role.</p>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<p class="h4">Narrow Passion Attributes</p>
				<p>The advantage of a narrow Passion Attribute like <em>Win the Trust of the Grand Vizier</em> is that it 
				tells the Game Master exactly what the player wants to have adventures about. She wants to have adventures 
				where she can make herself useful to the Grand Vizier and rise in his esteem. She tells this to the GM 
				clearly, and the GM knows what kind of elements to build into the dynamic situation she prepares for the 
				scenario to engage this Player and her narrow Passion Attribute.</p>
				
				<p>The disadavantage of the narrow Passion Attribute is that, while it's clear in defining the Player’s 
				expectations, it will only be engaged by select and specific circumstances. A situation that offers - for 
				example - an opportunity to gain favour with the King himself would not engage the Passion Attribute 
				orientated towards the Grand Vizier. Unless a narrow Passion Attribute is changed frequently — about every 
				second or third session — it will lead to extremely repetitive adventures.</p>
				
				<p>There is a second, potential disadvantage of narrow Passion Attributes, one that enters play in groups 
				with many Players and becomes aggravated if narrow Passion Attributse abound amongst them. It can be 
				difficult, sometimes substantially so, for a Game Master to come up with situations that engage <em>many</em> 
				narrow Passions. If everyone has a narrow interest, finding something that piques everbody’s interest isn’t 
				easy.</p>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<p class="h4">Intermediate Passion Attributes</p>
				<p>Intermediate Passion Attributes like <em>Amass Political Influence</em> combine the advantages and 
				disadvanatges from both broad and narrow Passion Attributes to a lesser extent. It tells the Game Master more 
				than the broad Passion Attribute, without limiting him in the way the narrow one does. It will be engaged 
				frequently, without the resulting adventures appearing as copies of one another.</p>
				
				<p>While it might appear that an intermediate scope is "best", it shouldn't be thought of that way. Broad and 
				narrow Passions can be just as fun and just as useful, if they are mixed well. A Player Character with only 
				broad Passions will be just as problematic as a Character with only narrow Passions. The secret’s in a good 
				mixture: A broad Passion Attribute or two to cut the GM some slack in coming up with scenarios and situations 
				engaging your Character and to provide yourself with some broadly applicable bonus dice, and a narrow Passion 
				or two to exactly tell the Game Master what you want out of the game <em>right now</em> and to afford him an 
				opportunity to really make your Character into an episode’s main protagonist.</p>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<p class="h4">Wide and Tight Passion Attribute Spreads</p>
				<p>A second item to consider in creating a Character’s Passion Attributes is their "spread", that is to say, 
				whether they're geared toward the pursuit of several different goals or pointed at closely related ones. For 
				the sake of this discussion, I am going to call the former a "wide" spread, and the latter a "tight" 
				spread.</p>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<p class="h4">The Wide Spread</p>
				<p>A wide spread - one where a Character’s Passions have little to no overlap - has the advantage of being 
				easy on the Game Master. As the player communicates a wide range of interests to pursue through scenarios, 
				the GM should have little difficulty in involving that character in a scenario. The advatage to the Player 
				is that she is virtually assured that one of her Passion Attributes will be engaged in every scene of every 
				scenario. If it isn’t, the GM really isn’t doing her job, considering how easy it was made for hrt by the 
				Player in setting up a wide spread of Passion Attributes.</p>
				
				<p>The didsadvantage of such a wide spread is that the Character will rarely encounter situations where more 
				than one of his Passion Attributes are engaged, meaning less bonus dice, both in combat and sorcery, where 
				the highest engaged Passion Attribute adds its rating in dice, plus one die for every other engaged Passion 
				Attribute, as everywhere else, where only the highest engaged Passion Attribute adds its rating — if only 
				one Passion Attributes happens to be activated, there is no choice of applying the “highest” activated 
				one.</p>
				
				<hr/>
				
				<p class="h4">The Tight Spread</p>
				<p>A tight spread, where most or all of a Character’s Passion Attributes do overlap, has the advantage that 
				several of them will usually be engaged at once and thus of providing more bonus dice.</p>
				
				<p>The disadvantage is mainly one for the GM, and it is similar to the one of narrow Passion Attributes: 
				If a Player expresses interest in only one pursuit, it can be hard for the Game Master to consistently come 
				up with scenes that pique this interest and engage the Passion Attributes, especially if the group is large. 
				If a Player is as unkind to his GM as to give him only a tight spread of Passion Attributes to work with in 
				designing scenes, the Game Master should be excused if he does occasionally frame scenes that do not engage 
				any of the Passions of that Player. This is doubly true if the group is large, and triply so if that Player’s 
				Passions are also mostly narrow in scope (though it will be rare to have a tight spread of narrow Passion 
				Attributes; a mixture of broad, narrow and intermediate Passion Attributes clustered tightly will be more 
				common).</p>
