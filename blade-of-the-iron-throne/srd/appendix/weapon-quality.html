			<p class="h4">Weapon Quality</p>
			<p>In <em>Blade</em>, different qualities of weapons are not handled with modifications to the weapons’ stats, 
			but rather as situational modifiers that come into play when a weapon of better quality opposes one of lower 
			quality. In such cases, the wielder of the better weapon receives a +1 bonus to his MP. This +1 is sufficient to 
			cover basically all differences in weapon quality, but in those rare cases when the difference seems huge – as 
			for instance in a master weapon smith’s steel sword opposing a bronze sword. In addition, the wielder of the 
			lesser weapon can also be penalized with –1 die to his MP.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_EnchantedWeapons">Enchanted Weapons</p>
			<p>In the Sword & Sorcery genre, magical weapons are exceedingly rare, and most campaigns of <em>Blade</em> could 
			be played out without even a single enchanted weapon figuring in them; in any case, there rarely should ever be 
			more than a single magic weapon per campaign.</p>
			
			<p>With enchanted weapons being so scarce, it should be clear that they cannot be treated as mere combat 
			efficiency booster. No, magic weapons in <em>Blade</em> are artifacts with a purpose, of a stature on par with 
			Stormbringer or Excalibur. The recommended way to handle such a powerful artifact is to provide it with its own 
			individual Passion Attribute.</p>
			
			<p>At the beginning of every combat Round, the wielder of the weapon may choose whether to add the entire 
			Passion score of the weapon to his MP, or but 1 point. If he decides to add the entire score, the weapon’s 
			Passion rating will drop by 1 point, but if he decides to add but 1 point, the rating remains unchanged. Note 
			also that some artifacts are sufficiently willful to withhold use of their full Passion Attribute if currently 
			at cross purposes with the wielder; in that case, only 1 point can be added, period, until the weapon is once 
			again mollified.</p>
			
			<p>How the weapon’s Passion Attribute is recharged depends on the purpose of the weapon. As a rule of the thumb, 
			most weapons will regain 1 Passion point every time they slay or maim an opponent, 1 additional point if 
			overcoming this opponent furthers the goal of the weapon, and 1-point every time the wielder does something 
			that furthers the cause of the weapon. However, some rare artifacts may be willful enough to not only withhold 
			their full benefits but to actually actively oppose their wielder. Such weapons can deduct 1 die from its 
			wielder’s MP, but every time it does so, its Passion score drops by 1.</p>
