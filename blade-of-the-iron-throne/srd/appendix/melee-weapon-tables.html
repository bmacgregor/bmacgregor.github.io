			<p>The one weapon everyone has is his body. Variations of unarmed combat exist all over the world. This 
			version is popular throughout the western half. Brawling involves, first and foremost, punching and kicking - 
			delivered by means of the Bash Maneuver –and also grappling and plenty of dirty tricks. While mostly an unarmed 
			Proficiency, the use of knuckledusters, saps and the like is also incorporated.</p>

			<br/>
			
			<p>Swing-type Offensive Maneuvers with a punch require an additional +1 MP Activation Cost (minimum 1). Bash 
			Activation Cost 0 is for punches, 1 for kicks and any other Bashes that might come up.</p>
			
			<p>Damage Rating for both punches and kicks is reduced by –1 against pliable textile and leather armor, and 
			by –2 against any other type of armor.</p>
			
			<p>A kick can equally be aimed at Hand and Short Reach, but requires an additional 1 MP Activation Cost if at 
			Short Reach (minimum 1).</p>
			
			<p>Use of a knuckleduster or metal-capped boots or an equivalent will increase punch and kick DRs respectively 
			by +1.</p>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>Common sense is needed in adjudicating what body parts can be targets of unarmed attacks and what attacks 
			can be defended against unarmed. Unless the opponent is in something other than an upright position, kicks can 
			usually not be aimed higher than the hips, and punches cannot usually be thrown lower than the groin. For 
			defence, the leg can usually not parry attacks aimed higher than the hips, and arms cannot usually parry 
			attacks aimed lower than the thighs.</p>
			
			<p>A successful parry with hand or foot against anything other than an unarmed attack will result in damage to 
			the parrying limb.</p>
			
			<p>Against a swung Cleaving attack, the parrying limb suffers a hit as if struck from an attack with 
			<strong>double the QoS the attacker actually achieved, and against all other attack forms one and a half times the 
			QoS the attacker ultimately achieved. The final wound to the defender is thus calculated as if the attack had 
			been aimed at the limb to which damage is now inflicted</strong>.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Brawling">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Galba thrusts at unarmed Otho’s belly with a dagger. Galba’s 8 attack dice 
				yield 5 successes and Otho’s 9 parrying dice yield 6 successes, successfully deflecting the belly thrust. 
				To see whether Otho managed to full deflect the dagger, Galba’s attack successes are multiplied by 1.5, 
				for a total of 8 successes, from which Otho’s 6 parrying successes are subtracted, for a difference of 2 
				in Galba’s favor.</p>
				
				<p>Adding the dagger’s Damage Rating (0), Galba’s BN (4 halved to 2, for damage purposes, remember?), +QoS 
				of 2 equals 4 total. We then subtract Otho’s BN (5 halved to 3) and hand armor (0) leaving us with a level 
				1 wound to Otho’s hand – a small price to pay for averting a knife in the belly.</em></p>

			<p>As fighting from horseback became more and more practical and efficient, heavy cavalry came into being. 
			Cavalry’s weapon of choice in an opening charge is the lance, a long spear, frequently of specialized design. 
			This weapon is found anywhere there are knights or heavy cavalry. Lances range from 2.5 to just over 4 meters 
			in length.</p>
			
			<p>They are usually butted under the right arm and used with a shield. Lances, though made of wood, are usually 
			capped with a long steel or iron point. A sporting version, the jousting lance, has a blunted tip for 
			tournaments. The primary advantages to a lance are its range and power in a charge, where it uses the mount’s 
			full BN, not half the riders BN, to calculate Impact Rating.</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_Longsword">Longsword</p>
			<p>For those warriors who prefer to fight without shields, large swords are very popular. They are fierce 
			weapons, capable of heavy damage when cleaving or thrusting, and they are excellent for complex maneuvering 
			and countering.</p>
			
			<p>The Longsword Proficiency incorporates all swords that are primarily intended for two-handed wielding. 
			However, Longwords are still short enough to be wielded in just one hand with little or no discomfort. The 
			primary advantages of these weapons include extended range, great cleaving power, and a wide variety of 
			Maneuvers.</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_MassWeapon">Mass Weapon</p>
			<p>Since the earliest clubs, mass weapons have found their place in warfare. Alongside the development of 
			better armor, clubs and farming tools were transformed into battle-axes, picks, flails, morning stars, and 
			maces. These weapons are in use the world over and are particularly popular both with the peasant infantryman 
			(these weapons are cheap) and the armored gentry (these weapons are especially effective against tougher 
			armors). Mass weapons include any single-handed (and occasionally two-handed) weapon that is particularly 
			heavy on the business end.</p>
			
			<p>These weapons’ balance makes them slow on the parry and commends the use of constant evasion or- more 
			commonly- shields. Most axes and hammers are fitted with a secondary spike or hammer on the back and/or top. 
			To flip the weapon over, spend 1 MP <strong>if done during a Combat Round</strong>. As with Pole-arms, exact 
			Maneuvers are dependent on the weapon at hand, and discretion and common sense need to be used. This 
			Proficiency may also be used without a shield at no penalty, but any shield based Maneuvers are, in that case, 
			impossible.</p>
