			<p class="h2">Travel and Scene Framing</p>
			<p>From our point of view, travel in <em>Blade</em>, whether by land or sea, should normally be abstracted by 
			the Game Master to a large degree. Because of this, there are no movement rates listed in <em>Blade</em> for 
			such activity. This snipping out of mundane elements of travel falls under the collective tent of Scene 
			Framing.</p>
			
			<p>With Scene Framing, the GM prunes out much of the typical flow of descriptions of what happens to the 
			Characters, and instead focuses his energy on scenes that are directly linked to the Player’s Passions, and 
			thus their interests. Bear in mind that even with Scene Framing, none of the game is actually being skipped. 
			Instead, arbitrary events are simply not played out center-stage within the group’s story.</p>

		<div class="panel-body">
		
			<p>While seemingly counter-intuitive, we urge Game Masters to embrace this by refraining from the lengthy 
			setting descriptions that are typically employed to increase a setting’s immersion factor. This of course will 
			involve having a dialogue with your gaming group to best determine how much setting description they want for 
			their <em>Blade</em> experience. We respect the fact that some groups truly do enjoy much of the detail of a 
			well-envisioned setting, and for those groups we suggest the use of Transitional Scenes, which play out like 
			short film clips, and whose single purpose is to move the Characters from one scene to the next.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Travel">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: If the Characters are traveling by ship, the Game Master could take a few 
				minutes to describe the terrific storm that batters the ship, the 15-meter-high waves that break over the 
				vessel’s bow, and the sodden miserable attempts of the Characters to grab a few precious hours of sleep. 
				Taking a few moments to describe such a scene, as well as giving the Players a chance to role-play their 
				Characters shouting a few choice epithets at the heavens, can simultaneously serve both the colour of a 
				setting and the advancement of the story.</em></p>
