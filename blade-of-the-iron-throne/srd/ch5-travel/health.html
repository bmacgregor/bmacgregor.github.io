			<p class="h2">Health, Healing, and Wounds</p>
			<p>In <em>Blade</em>, even a slight wound is no laughing matter. For the healing process to begin in earnest, 
			there are some mandates:</p>
			
			<p>First, you must be in a state of rest. Second, at least for the more serious wounds, you need some form of 
			treatment. Wounds can be tended to by anyone possessing the Healing Skill. Note that each wound must be 
			treated individually. A successful Healing Skill Check reduces Blood Loss by 3 per Success. A failed Healing 
			Check <em>increases</em> Blood Loss by 1, while a Botched Healing Check <strong>doubles</strong> the wound’s 
			Blood Loss.</p>

	<div class="container text-justify">
		<div class="panel-body">
			<p class="h4">Dealing with Bloodloss</p>
			<p>At the end of the Limelight in which the Character first acquired points of Blood Loss and on the end of 
			each subsequent Limelight, a Brawn check is required. This Check must yield Successes equal to or greater than 
			the current Blood Loss number.</p>
			
			<p>With this in mind, any Limelight Blood Loss Check made while the subject is at rest (or at most, moving or 
			walking very slowly) requires one less Success than indicated by the current Blood Loss rating to be 
			successful. This includes characters unconscious from Blood Loss. However, even if a character’s Blood Loss 
			rating is reduced to 0, the penalties accrued due to bleeding will not diminish immediately. Such penalties are 
			reduced by 2 for the Melee, Archery, and Sorcery Pools for each passing day spent resting with proper 
			nourishment and low activity, or by 1 per passing day of exertion.</p>
			
			<p>Any Wound Level beyond 2 calls for a chirurgeon (someone with the Healing Skill at level 3 or higher). At 
			the end of each week make a Tenacity Check versus the Pain rating of each individual wound. Each Success lowers 
			that wound’s Pain value by 1. This Check is modified by three things: Rest, medical care, and damage type.</p>
			
			<p>During convalescence, moderate activity with no more than one or two instances of strenuous activity is 
			assumed. If a Character spends a week completely at rest, with no more than occasional light activity, the 
			Tenacity Check for each injury is made against a Target Number of (Pain - 1). On the other hand, if she doesn’t 
			take it easy, the Target Number is equal to (Pain + 1).</p>
			
			<p>A caregiver Character using the Healing Skill and available throughout much of the week of healing time may 
			make a Skill Check before the patient rolls. Each Success in this Check lowers the difficulty of all 
			patient-rolled healing Checks for this week by 1. Failure adds nothing, but if no success are achieved on the 
			Skill Check, all the patient’s healing Checks for the week are made at a +2 Target Number.</p>
			
			<p>Damage type — meaning Cleaving, Piercing, or Blunt— affects this TenaciY Check as well. To heal a Blunt 
			wound, the basic Target Number is equal to Pain, but Piercing or Cleaving injuries heal with a basic Target 
			Number of (Pain + 1).</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_FallingDamage">Falling Damage</p>
			<p>Falling is defined as the free descent by force of gravity. All damage derived from falling is a result of 
			both the distance fallen and the surface landed upon. See the following table.</p>
			
			<p class="h4">Falling Damage Table</p>
			<table class="table table-striped table-hover" id="TBL_FallingDamage">
				<thead>
					<th>Landing Surface</th>
					<th>Damage Rating</th>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Soft; a large pile of hay, a featherbed, water (with a successful Swimming check)</td>
						<td>One per Three Meters fallen</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Mixed; a crowd of people, falling (not diving) into shallow water, muddy banks</td>
						<td>One per Two Meters fallen</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Hard; ground, stone, armoured people falling from horses, water (with a failed Swimming 
						check)</td>
						<td>One per Meter fallen</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			
			<p>All damage caused by the fall is Blunt damage. Damage is randomly assigned to some location on the 
			recipient’s body; for every two points of damage suffered, roll once on the following table and assign damage 
			accordingly. Damage to any area rolled more than once is cumulative, and applied with a single d6 roll on the 
			Target Zone Charts (See Appendices).</p>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_AllocateFallDamage">Allocation of Falling Damage</p>
			<table class="table table-striped table-hover" id="TBL_AllocateFallDamage">
				<thead>
					<th>d12 Roll</th>
					<th>Area Location</th>

				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>1 - 2</td>
						<td>One</td>

					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			
			<p>Only the longest of falls can affect more than one Target Zone. The number of Zones the damage can be spread 
			to can never be higher than two, or one quarter the fall’s height in meters, whichever is greater. As soon as 
			this number of Zones has been derived, further damage is assigned randomly to the Zones already determined.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Falling">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho is knocked from his horse. The fall from the saddle corresponds to a 
				fall of 2m to the hard ground. Consulting Table 5.3, we see that’s a hard fall. He then rolls 3 and 4 on a 
				D12. Consulting Table 5.4 we note that Otho takes a level two Blunt wound to his upper leg (area 2). He 
				now must roll 1D6 on the Damage Table in the Appendices to determine the exact location of the 
				injury.</em></p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_GenericDamage">Generic Damage</p>
			<p>Any damage from fire, cold, electricity, sorcery, the elements, or not specifically covered by rules uses 
			the “Generic Damage” chart in the Appendix. Such damage is calculated like damage from any other attack 
			described in chapter four. Such damage is applied randomly using the Falling Damage Table, unless impacting a 
			specific area (such as someone with a flaming arrow, in which case any fire damage is simply applied to the 
			area struck).</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Poison">Poison</p>
			<p>When a Character is poisoned, she must pass frequent Checks to avoid advancing along the six levels of the 
			Poison Track, which, much like the six combat Wound Levels are progressive in their severity. Should she 
			advance to Poison Level 6, she dies. The frequency of such “Progression” Checks (using the Knockout Attribute) 
			depend on how fast the poison acts. Such can either be:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>A Limelight</li>
				<li>A few minutes</li>
				<li>Half an hour</li>
				<li>A few hours</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Ingested poisons generally have a progression rate of a half hour to several hours, unless sorcerous in 
			nature, in which case they may have a progression time of only a few minutes.</p>
			
			<p>Injected poisons generally have a progression rate of a few minutes to one half hour, but if injected to the 
			head, neck, or torso, become faster by one “step”. In such cases, a progression rate of a single Limelight 
			is possible. To successfully inject a poison, no Wound Levels need be inflicted. For as long as the poison 
			attack’s Impact Rating surpasses the victim’s Armour Value, the poison is successfully injected, even if Brawn 
			soaks up all actual damage.</p>
			
			<p>To avoid advancing along the Poison Track, a Progression Check must be passed. This Check’s required amount 
			of successes is dependent on the strength of the poison being resisted. Such Checks typically must yield a  
			Qulaity of Success of 2 or 3. Poisons requiring a Quality of Success 1 certainly exist and are much more common 
			than the more virulent ones, but their progression is hardly dramatic enough to bother with at all.</p>
			
			<p>Conversely, poisons necessitating Quality of Success 4 or greater are possible, but are so sublimely deadly 
			that Game Masters are strongly advised to have them appear more as a threat of something to avoid at all costs, 
			rather than something to actually afflict on the Characters.</p>
			
			<p>Medical aid can be provided to the afflicted by any Character with either the Apothecary or the Healing 
			Skill. A successful Apothecary Check with a Challenge Level equalling the virulence of the poison (the Quality 
			of Success required by the Knockout Check to avoid further progression on the Poison Track) will lower the 
			Target Number of further Progression Checks by 1.</p>
			
			<p>A Check using the Healing Skill brings the same benefit, but instead must meet a Challenge Level equal to 
			twice the poison’s virulence. Once a Character has passed three successive poison Progression Checks, further 
			advancement on the Poison Track is stopped, and the Character has “ridden out” the poisoning. From this point 
			on he must pass a Knockout Check every few hours at a Target Number of 7, with the poison recovery Challenge 
			Level equal to the poison’s current virulence.</p>
			
			<p>Successfully meeting this Check signifies one step back along the Poison Progression Chart and a 
			reduction to the poison’s recovery Challenge Level. This downward spiral of Checks continues until the effects 
			of the poisoning fade completely and the subject is hale once more.</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_ItsJustAScratch">Pain - It's Just a Scratch! (Optional)</p>
			<p>The protagonists of Sword & Sorcery tales are notoriously tough. Whether because of an indomitable force of 
			will or just sheer machismo, they often shrug off hurt that would lay low lesser men. The same is true for 
			Characters and named NPCs in <em>Blade</em>.</p>
			
			<p>As soon as the action in a scene in which the Character has received a wound subsides, the higher of either 
			Brawn or Tenacity may be Checked for the Character (Passion Attributes are not applied to this Check!). Once 
			Checked, an amount of Pain equal to the Quality of Success of the successful Check may be subtracted from any 
			newly inflicted wounds. The Player then decides how this Quality of Success bonus is applied against those 
			wounds, distributing Pain relief to any fresh wound as desired.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_JustAScratch">
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Otho has 3 cuts received during the fight he just emerged from as victor:</p></em>
				
				<ul>
					<li>A Pain 1 cut to his hand</li>
					<li>A Pain 1 cut to his jaw</li>
					<li>A Pain 2 cut to his side</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Rolling against a Target Number of 7 with his Tenacity (because Otho's Tenacity is higher than his 
				Brawn) he scores 3 Successes and opts to reduce the Pain 2 cut to his side down to zero, and to also get 
				rid of the Pain 1 cut to his hand. The cut to his jaw he opts to leave as a dueling scar for the ladies to 
				admire.</em></p>
