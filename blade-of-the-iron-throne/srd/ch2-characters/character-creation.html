			<p>Characters in <em>Blade</em> are painted in broad strokes by their Talents. These Talents, primarily 
			Attributes, Skills, and Proficiencies, are used by the player as a metric of their Character’s strengths and 
			weaknesses.</p>
			
			<p>Players can and should consult the wide body of Sword & Sorcery literature available for their inspiration. 
			Joining in with their Game Maser and fellow players, they can then exchange ideas and work on creating 
			Character histories (and Passions) that will work in harmony with the rest of the group’s goals and story 
			direction.</p>

			<p class="h4">Characters and Talents (Continued)</p>
			<p>This is where the <a href="talent-table.html">Talent Table</a> now comes into play. Our particular 
			<em>Blade</em> Talent Table is comprised of six Talents. While the described categories of Attributes, Skills, 
			nd Proficiencies form the heart of the entries on the <em>Blade</em> Talent Table, there are many more 
			possibilities that could be made for your game.</p>
			
			<p class="h4">Talents</p>
			<p>Having by now gotten a sense of the Character that they wish to build stories around, Players then translate 
			these ideas to <em>Blade</em> by selecting Talent levels based on their importance to the player’s vision of 
			their Character. Will the character be a man of fierce fighting ability? Or, perhaps a deft thief prowling the 
			rooftops of fantastic cities! <strong>The prime focus of the Character should be their A or B picks</strong>.</p>
			
			<p>Next come aspects of the character that should still demonstrate competence or training. These will likely 
			merit a C or D pick.</p>
			
			<p>Last comes those picks that the player has determined are not of major concern to his <em>Blade</em> 
			experience, the E and F picks. Bear in mind, these last choices are where the Character will be at their 
			weakest - choose carefully!</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Sorcery">Sorcery</p>
			<p>The lands of the Sword & Sorcery campaign, though dominated by skillful swordsmen, are haunted by powerful 
			Sorcerers wielding their dark magic. The Sorcery Priority governs the relation of your Character to the occult 
			mysteries of the supernatural, whether your character is steeped in them, a regular person, or victimized by 
			those dark forces. If you plan on playing a non-sorcerer Character, then select either <em>Mundane</em> as your 
			Priority D (the Average priority), or <em>Cursed</em> as your Priority E. Selecting <em>Doomed</em> as your 
			Priority F also gives you a character without sorcerous powers, but shouldn’t be done lightly; the character 
			is not likely to survive this choice.</p>
			
			<p>If you want to play any type of wielder of arcane powers, chose Sorcery as your Priority A, B, or C, 
			but choose carefully as <strong>the sorcerous Mysteries to which those Picks give your character access are 
			all she will ever be able to learn</strong>; no sorcerer can ever learn more Mysteries than those allowed by 
			his initial Sorcery Pick.</p>
			
			<p>Once you have made your choice, create a background that fits your concept, discussing your choice with 
			your fellow Players and the GM. This gives others the chance to riff off your inspiration and create 
			character origins that will work well with your own.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body" id="DIV_SorceryPicks">
				<p class="h4" id="P_Sorc_Mysteriarch">A : Mysteriarch</p>
				<p>A Mysteriarch is one of the greatest masters of the arcane alive. He can know all Mysteries, both 
				Lesser and Greater, and he starts out the game with knowledge of a single Arcane Secret. He receives 
				one free point in the Occultism Skill and one free Proficiency point to spend on Mysteries, but may not 
				put more Proficiency points into Greater than into Lesser Mysteries.</p>
				
				<p class="h4" id="P_Sorc_Sorcerer">B : Sorcerer</p>
				<p>Sorcerer denotes somebody deeply steeped and well versed in arcane knowledge. She can know either all 
				six Lesser Mysteries, or three Lesser and one Greater Mystery. She receives one free point in the 
				Occultism Skill.</p>
				
				<p>Should she opt for a Greater Mystery, it may be of no greater value than his highest Lesser 
				Mystery.</p>
				
				<p class="h4" id="P_Sorc_Dabbler">C : Dabbler</p>
				<p>Dabbler encompasses hedge wizards, witch doctors, sages of secret lore, some of the more devoted 
				cultists of unwholesome deities and other serious meddlers in the occult. Such characters may know up 
				to two Lesser Mysteries and may also have the Occultism Skill. Enslavement and Witchfire may not both 
				be chosen.</p>
				
				<p class="h4" id="P_Sorc_Mundane">D : Mundane</p>
				<p>Mundane denotes the common man. He has heard whispers of sorcery but has most likely never 
				encountered it, has no affinity for it, and most certainly doesn’t know any.</p>
				
				<p class="h4" id="P_Sorc_Cursed">E : Cursed</p>
				<p>Cursed denotes a person not only unskilled in the arcane, but also somehow particularly vulnerable 
				to harmful sorcery. When she checks to resist sorcerous harm or influence, she does so at a +2 
				Target Number penalty.</p>
				
				<p class="h4" id="P_Sorc_Doomed">F : Doomed</p>
				<p>Doomed is a person not only devastatingly open to harmful sorcery, but actually victimized by it. He 
				resists sorcery as per the E Pick, Cursed (at a +2 Target Number penalty), and on top of this has 
				already contracted some kind of terrible supernatural doom. This doom is geared toward a specific, utterly 
				ruinous fate, expressing itself in mechanical terms as the equivalent of a Curse Rating six (See the 
				<a href="../ch6-sorcery/sorcerous-mysteries/#P_LSR_Cursing">Cursing Mystery</a>), which can be lifted by 
				neither faith or sorcery.</p>
				
				<p>This doom need not be geared toward the Character's death, but if it isn’t it needs to be geared to the 
				total destruction of all the Character holds dear and wants to achieve. Whatever the doom may be, it must 
				run its course, undoing the Character in some nasty fashion. Alternatively, it might be remotely possible 
				to lift by means of an impossible quest. Such a quest should take up more than five game sessions devoted 
				solely to it, during which time the Character (and likely his companions) should face more than even odds 
				of dying at least three times; in short, the Game Master should make sure that such a quest fails more 
				often than it succeeds.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Please be advised that this Priority Pick should not be taken lightly! The severity of the curse 
				will more likely than not result in the destruction of the PC before the quest to lift it can be 
				completed.</strong></p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_Culture">Culture</p>
			<p>The Protagonists of the Sword & Sorcery genre are often quite a bit darker than those of heroic fantasy 
			works like Tolkien’s <em>Lord of the Rings</em>. They tend to be outsiders or social outcasts, rejected or 
			looked down upon by the powers of the society they find themselves in. Sword and Sorcery also diverges sharply 
			from high fantasy in that non-humans such as elves and dwarves typically don’t exist, and both Player 
			Characters and Non-Player Characters tend to be Human.</p>
			
			<p>The archetypes listed are not meant as character classes, nor do they represent Human realities, but 
			rather are descriptive clichés of the genre; tropes that can be used to distinguish characters that 
			otherwise would have the same racial abilities.</p>
		
			<div class="panel-body" id="DIV_CulturePicks">
				<p class="h4" id="P_Cult_Enlightened">A : Enlightened</p>
				<p>A few great civilizations rise above others and gain near mythical status. Learned beyond normal 
				men, people of enlightened cultures are builders of cyclopean pyramids and towers that pierce the 
				skies. Their magnificent buildings can last forever, and likewise monuments to an enlightened one’s 
				achievement can withstand the passage of time. Enlightened characters are especially long lived and 
				begin play with these modifiers:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>+1 each to Tenacity, Sagacity and Heart; minimum 2, maximum 8/9</li>
					<li>One bonus supernatural or culture related Asset Occultism Skill always allowed</li>
					<li>Fourteen (14) bonus Skill points</li>
					<li>Enlightened Ones live half again to three times as long as mere mortals and need little to 
					no sustenance or sleep</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p class="h4" id="P_Cult_Savage">B : Savage</p>
				<p>Savages include warriors from the frozen north and witch-doctors from the trackless wastes of the 
				south. Savages tend to have a close connection with nature, but remain ignorant of many developments 
				that more civilized people take for granted. Savage characters begin play with these modifiers:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>+1 each to Brawn, Daring and Tenacity; minimum 2, maximum 8/9</li>
					<li>Seven (7) bonus Skill points related to Survival, Climbing, Animal Ken, etc.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p class="h4" id="P_Cult_HillmanNomad">C : Hillman / Nomad</p>
				<p>Hillmen live in broken mountainous regions that are hard to traverse. Their homeland lies either at 
				the edge of civilized lands or is surrounded by them and might even be at least nominally part of a 
				civilized nation. In any case, the isolation offered by their hills make Hillmen independent, 
				and it is not uncommon for them to sally forth from their mountain fastness to prey upon softer people, 
				forcibly collecting tribute from all who trespass their land.</p>
				
				<p>Nomads roam the empty wastes beyond the civilized cities; quick to strike and bound by no laws. 
				Nomads live with their animals and usually ride into battle with them; they feel ill at ease without 
				them. Nomadic and Hillmen characters begin play with the following modifiers:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Seven (7) bonus Skill points related to Survival, Climbing, Animal Ken, etc.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p class="h4" id="P_Cult_Civilized">D : Civilized</p>
				<p>Savages and Hillmen eventually gather together to cultivate the land, build great cities, develop 
				trade, and study medicine, mathematics and languages. In the civilized lands dwell noble knights, wise 
				kings, and learned sages — as well as greedy merchants and cunning thieves. Civilized characters begin 
				play with no particular advantages or disadvantages.</p>
				
				<p class="h4" id="P_Cult_Decadent">E : Decadent</p>
				<p>Great civilizations reach their peak and eventually start to decline. Such fallen empires are ruled 
				by jaded nobles, corrupt priests and wicked slave-traders. Demon-worship, human sacrifice and drug 
				abuse is all too common in these cultures. Decadent characters begin play with the following 
				modifiers:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>-1 to Tenacity; minimum 1, maximum 7</li>
					<li>Either -1 to Brawn (minimum 1, maximum 7) or one Poor Asset related to mental handicaps like 
					Addiction, Sadism, etc.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p class="h4" id="P_Cult_Degenerate">F : Degenerate</p>
				<p>The last survivors of decadent civilizations start to feud over dwindling resources, or are driven 
				away by stronger cultures. Fleeing into the wilderness, or deep underground beneath their ruins, they 
				start to inbreed and devolve into something no longer entirely human. Degenerates may outwardly 
				resemble savages, but they carry the evil taint of fallen empires. Degenerate characters begin play 
				with the following modifiers:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>-1 to three Attributes; minimum 1, maximum 7</li>
					<li>Two Poor Assets chosen by player, focused on bodily handicaps and gruesome mental illnesses 
					such as Necrophilia, Inhuman, etc.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4" id="P_Attributes">Attributes</p>
			<p>Assigning points to your attributes is vital to constructing an exciting character. Each player is given 
			a number of points to distribute amongst the six Basic Attributes. Available points are determined by the 
			Priority level selected.</p>
			
			<p>These points are assigned as you will, with but two cautions: All players must nominate one of their 
			attributes as their “Focus.” No other attribute may exceed the point value of the “Focus” during the 
			process of character creation.</p>
			
			<p>In addition, <strong>no character should start with any Attribute at the unique level of nine</strong>. This 
			level is reserved for development during play.</p>
			
			<p>Next, work with your fellow players and Game Master to create your four Passion Attributes and fill them in 
			on your character sheet. Beginning Passion Attribute Points are the same for each beginning character: Seven 
			(7) points to be distributed between the four open Attributes and the fixed Drama Attribute. Any given 
			Passion Attribute may be as low as zero or as high as five. Passion Attributes are described 
			<a href="../ch1 Mechanics/Passions.html">here</a>.</p>
			
			<p>Combined Attributes are calculated by combining two or more existing attributes. These should be 
			calculated once all Basic and Passion Attributes are finalized. All numbers equal to or greater than .50 
			are rounded up.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Reflex = (Cunning + Daring) / 2</li>
				<li>Aim = (Cunning + Sagacity) / 2</li>
				<li>Knockdown = (Brawn + Daring) / 2</li>
				<li>Knockout = (Brawn + Tenacity) / 2</li>
				<li>Move = (Brawn + Cunning + Daring) / 3</li>

			<p class="h4" id="P_Skills">Skills</p>
			<p>Next, assign all available Skill points to those Skills you desire for your character. Again, available

			Skill at level nine. Pay close attention for any Sorcery, Cultural, or Asset modifiers to your Skills that you 
			may be entitled to, and once each Skill has been chosen; write those Skills down on your sheet.</p>

			<p>Proficiencies refer to weapons' training. Each selected Melee Proficiency or Missile Proficiency conveys

			Proficiency may start out with the maximum rating of thirteen.</p>

			<p class="h4" id="P_Assets">Assets</p>
			<p>Assets are aspects of a character’s personality, background, or physique, that make him better at some 
			activities (Good) and worse at others (Poor) depending on which portion of the Asset is being explored. 
			In addition to their mechanical effects, Assets suggest characteristics about the Character’s personality 
			that might lead to interesting role-playing opportunities.</p>
			
			<p>Assets offer a way for game mechanics to encourage deeper character backgrounds and more consistent 
			role-playing.</p>
			
			<p>Any character can begin play with up to six Good or three Poor Assets, chosen by the Player at the time 
			of character creation, plus any other Assets the character may derive from other Picks such as Culture. On 
			top of the Good or Poor Assets gained from his Picks, a player may opt to choose one (and only one), 
			additional Good Asset for his character, if he balances this with a Poor Asset.</p>
			
			<p>When selecting your “Good” or “Poor” Asset keep in mind that the entire Asset (both Good and Poor) is 
			now yours to develop as you wish, but whatever form (again, Good or Poor) you initially selected it in will 
			be the aspect that you first focus your role-playing efforts on.</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning" id="DIV_Example_Assets">			
				<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: Picture a Barbarian who arrives in his first big city, a character 
				that has begun the game with the Poor aspect of the “Uncivilized” Asset. He’s a savage man in civilized 
				surroundings and therefore his asset would initially be rather detrimental to him.</p>
				
				<p>But over time as he gradually gets accustomed to city life, he learns to better deal with his own 
				uncivilized nature - he then begins to develop the Good aspect of the Asset, which reflects how he has 
				learned to use his own savage nature to his advantage in certain situations!</p>
				
				<p>With the passing of yet more adventure time, while he is still every bit as uncivilized as he was in 
				the beginning (years before in some cases), he no longer suffers for it, and has apparently learned to 
				compensate for it in other ways. The “Uncivilized” portion of his nature is truly now an advantage for 
				him!</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>As soon as you feel that you have explored the current aspect of the Asset to your (and the group’s) 
			satisfaction and would like to expand your role-playing vision, please feel free to purchase the Asset’s 
			opposite side. You can then move between the two aspects of the Asset as desired. When no longer interested 
			in the Asset you can always buy it off.</p>
			
			<p>For a complete listing and description of Assets, click <a href="../ch3-training/assets.html">here</a>.</p>
			
			<p><em><strong>Note that Poor Assets normally derived from the Culture Priority Pick can only be bought off 
			under exceptional circumstances, and only then if both the referee and the rest of the gaming group agree 
			that Characters experiences warrant such a radical development.</strong></em></p>
