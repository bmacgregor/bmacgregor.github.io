			<p>The Talent table as presented in this chapter is just one of many possible incarnations of this table; one 
			that will probably suit most games of <em>Blade</em>, but not necessarily all.</p>
			
			<p>To some settings, such as gritty historical ones, the Culture column might not apply; others might be either 
			devoid of anything supernatural or keeps such elements strictly out of players’ hands, and thus have no Sorcery 
			column; and while the Asset column will likely be common, not all referees will be interested in adding it.</p>

			<p class="h4">Creating Your Own Talent Table (Continued)</p>
			<p>The only three columns that are universal to all games of <em>Blade</em> are Attributes, Proficiencies, and 
			Skills. Some, but by no means all, possible ideas for the other priorities are:</p>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p class="h4">Race</p>
			<p>In campaigns where non-human races are more common than the default for Blade, the group might want to allow 
			players access to such races as Characters. A Race priority would regulate access to the various racial 
			packages.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4">Social</p>
			<p>In some campaigns the Players might have the option to have their Characters belong to widely different 
			social classes. A Social priority would give access to anything from slave to nobleman, with the attendant 
			wealth and legal privileges or limitations.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4">Connections</p>
			<p>Especially in campaigns of the cloak-and-dagger type, the extent of a Character's access to local flows of 
			power and information may be relevant. A Connections priority would determine how well-connected a Character 
			is.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4">Status</p>
			<p>In some campaigns all Characters might be members of the same organization, for instance a cult or an army. 
			A Status priority in such campaigns could be used to determine a Character's status within the organization, 
			from grunt to mover and shaker.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p class="h4">Design Notes</p>
			<p>The design of <em>Blade</em> endorses and encourages this type of column customization; take them, make them 
			your own, and remold them to best support the game you want to play. There’s no need to have a column that 
			isn’t truly important in your game. To help you design your own columns, here are the basics of how we have 
			designed ours:</p>
			
			<p>The D Pick is considered to be average, providing no special benefit or disadvantage. Descending the line 
			from D, E is noticeably worse, though not devastatingly so; the difference amounts to two Attribute or 
			Proficiency points, six Skill points, or one Asset.</p>
			
			<p>The F Pick is intended to be truly poor and is set about three times as far below in value to the D Pick as 
			the E Pick is; the equivalent of about six Attribute or Proficiency points, eighteen Skill points, or three 
			Assets seems about right to us.</p>
			
			<p>Our choice of numbering here is very deliberate; we wanted every step on the table away from D to be larger 
			than the one preceding it. This uneven stepping also applies when one ascends the line of the table from the 
			average D Pick.</p>
			
			<p>The C Pick equally scales improvement from the D Pick as much the E Pick worsens it; C and E are intended to 
			mirror the other’s separation from the D Pick.</p>
			
			<p>In contrast, the B Pick is not intended to mirror the F Pick in the same way. Instead there is a less 
			drastic improvement from C compared to the F Pick’s drop from D; the equivalent of three Attribute or 
			Proficiency points, nine Skill points, or two Assets better than C seems to us to be on target.</p>
			
			<p>The A Pick is obviously intended to be the most advantageous, and thus is about twice as rewarding compared 
			to the D Pick than the B Pick; the difference from A to D amounting to about ten Attribute or Proficiency 
			points, thirty Skill points, or six Assets.</p>
			
			<p>So now you have our architecture of the Talent table; now go forth and customize your own!</p>
