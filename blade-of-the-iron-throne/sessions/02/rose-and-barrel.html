      <p class="h4"><strong>The Rose and Barrel</strong></p>
      <p><em>Passing what seems to be an enclosure for a small number of livestock - a pair of goats, and some chickens - 
      you wander into the noisy common-room of the Rose and Barrel, seemingly the only tavern in Whitelake. Despite it not 
      yet being nightfall, the place is busy with all manner of folk sitting, drinking, and discussing a few choice topics - chief 
      among these seem to be the war, though there is some talk of Eldrani hostilities. Near the door you notice two down-on-their 
      luck travelers who make note of your arms and armour. One of them looks like he wants to wave you over, but hesitates, and 
      in a moment you hear a drunken bellow, as someone much drunker and louder than the two wanderers hollers something about 
      Kevanja and pushes himself away from the bar and lurches, drink in hand, in your direction.</em></p>
      
      <hr/>
      
      <p>The drunk is named Farstin. He's been drinking steadily since dawn, and while heavily intoxicated, doesn't pose much of a
      threat. He's absolutely boorish enough to make a scene of the Character's entrance however, and will definitely make remarks 
      about Amanda's Character's looks, as well as Abi's freakish beauty - loudly proclaiming that he'd love to take them both 
      upstairs, except Ranek - the inn's proprietor - doesn't let him use the place on credit anymore, not after the last time.</p>
      
      <p>Farstin will then lower his voice to a stage whisper, asking if Amanda and Abi have been "up to them damn creepy ruins 
      yet" - they haven't - and how he's "damn sure that there's more gold in there than you'd find in the whole of Marris, but 
      that the thing's sealed up tighter than an Eldrani arse-pipe." He'll let out an enormous laugh at this quip, and drain his 
      mug dry. After a few sips, he'll realize that his drink is empty, and will attempt to wheel "Beauty and her Beastly brother" 
      away to sit with him at the bar. For the entire exchange, the two dust-blown travelers by the door will be trying to get 
      Mike's attention.</p>
      
      <p>With Farstin out of the way, the bolder of the travelers (Hamptish) will approach Mike, and ask him to sit at their table. 
      They've noticed that he carries himself "like a trueborn warrior" and hope that he "might aid them in their plight." Their 
      names are Hamptish and Dolan, and they've recently been robbed.</p>
      
      <p>Farstin's talk with Abi and Amanda is described <a href="farstins-tale.html">here</a>.</p>
      
      <p>Hamptish and Dolan's unfortunate story is told <a href="robbed-by-bastards.html">here</a>.</p>
