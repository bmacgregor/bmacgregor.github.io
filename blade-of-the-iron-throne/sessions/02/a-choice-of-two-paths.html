			<p>If Crom has only solved a single half of the letter and returns to Percel, the shopkeep will deride 
			him for bringing incomplete information. He will tell Crom to leave the letter with him, and go deal with 
			the poisoned men, if they're still alive.</p>
			
			<p>If, however, the second part of the letter has been solved, Percel will scoff at the first and third 
			paragraphs, saying that these indeed must be a red-herring. He was expecting a message about the Eldrani 
			incursion into Fornholm, and the use of ruby earrings to identify agents is a time-honoured tradition. 
			This is, of course, a ruse, and Percel will tell Crom not to bother going to the meeting, saying that he - 
			Percel - will undertake this subtle piece of the job. He will send Crom on what he considers the wild 
			goose-chase of the first paragraph. Naturally, this message is actually the true letter, and the second 
			paragraph is the trap (which will result in Percel's death).</p>
			
			<p>Something similar will occur if both pieces of the letter is solved - Percel will insist on going to 
			the meeting, scoffing at Crom's character for falling for such a simple ruse.</p>
