      <p class="h4"><strong>Whitelake</strong></p>
      <p><em>You leave Palisin's hut, and head into Whitelake proper. The familiar crunch of frost-covered snow underfoot crackles 
      with every step, and you note the sun is lowering in the sky. It appears to be sometime in the late afternoon. With any 
      luck, the people of Whitelake will be milling around town, or at the local inn - a place that almost every village of 
      this size seems to have, and abound in rumors and idle gossip.</p>
      
      <p>The journey is fairly short, and you and your group can wander the streets as you like. There doesn't seem to be a 
      particularly strong law-enforcement here, and you suspect the town either handles its own issues through the use of 
      impromptu courts and defence using a volunteer militia.</p>
      
      <p>You can hear hints of conversation; someone mentions a handful of delirious travelers, suffering from some sort of 
      wasting illness. Hopefully Whitelake isn't on the verge of a plague.</em></p>
      
      <p>Now that you're all here, what would you like to do?</p>
      
      <hr/>
      
      <p>Players will likely split up, following their own threads. With any luck, Kerrin will go to investigate the rumors of 
      plague - she will find several delirious Eldrani soldiers disguised as roving tradesmen looking for work at the local 
      infirmary, being tended to by an elderly woman named Adra, detailed <a href="whitelake-infirmary.html">here</a>.</p>
      
      <p>Crom, from his note, will likely go in search of an Eldrani contact. He will find Alliver Percel, a local weaver and 
      purveyor of fine linens who is a deep-cover Eldrani agent placed on this side of the Channel, outlined 
      <a href="percels-shoppe.html">here</a>.</p>
      
      <p>With little else to go with, Abi, Mike, and Amanda will likely head to the local inn and brew house, the 
      <em>Rose and Barrel</em> where they will encounter a few colourful characters with plot hooks for them to investigate, 
      described <a href="rose-and-barrel.html">here</a>.</p>
      
      <hr/>
      
      <p>Whitelake itself - if the Players are curious - features a few interesting places. Other than a small market area, the 
      inn (and common-room), and infirmary, Whitelake is a fishing village, and has a sizable dockyard and harborage. Although the 
      boats aren't able to navigate the Weeper's Channel because of the winter's ice, a number of fishing huts have been set up 
      and are used quite heavily. The Channel isn't completely frozen, and the further from shore, the thinner the ice gets. 
      Telraven longships used to prowl these waters, and would raid the coastlands. These are memories that most elderly 
      Whitelake-folk still have, though it's been decades since the last attack. Telraven is another Nordic nation, and bitter 
      rivals of their Kevanjan neighbours. It might occur to Amanda that the Thanes-moot, an annual gathering of Telraven 
      clans, is probably taking place right about now.</p>
      
      <p>There's a small ship-works with an attached smithy. Due to the season, the ship-works doesn't see much business, and is 
      closed, but the smithy works throughout the year. A general goods store can be found in the market square, and can 
      provision Characters with the items they might need for a long journey. Due to Whitelake's size, however, and their 
      reliance on the Channel, they do not have a stables.</p>
      
      <p>If the Players are looking for a specific kind of shop or place, use your best judgement to decide if it would be in a 
      small fishing village.</p>
