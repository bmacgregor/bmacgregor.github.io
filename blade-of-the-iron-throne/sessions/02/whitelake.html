      <p class="h4"><strong>Whitelake</strong></p>
      <p><em>You leave Palisin's hut, and head off to Whitelake. The familiar crunch of frost-covered snow underfoot crackles 
      with every step, and you note the sun is lowering in the sky. It appears to be sometime in the mid-afternoon. With any 
      luck, the people of Whitelake will be milling around town, or at the local inn - a place that almost every village of 
      this size seems to have, and abound in rumors and idle gossip.</p>
      
      <p>The journey is fairly short, and you and your group can wander the streets as you like. There doesn't seem to be a 
      particularly strong law-enforcement here, and you suspect the town either handles its own issues through the use of 
      impromptu courts and defence using a volunteer militia.</p>
      
      <p>You can hear hints of conversation; someone mentions a handful of delerious travellers, suffering from some sort of 
      wasting illness. Hopefully Whitelake isn't on the verge of a plague.</em></p>
      
      <p>Now that you're all here, what would you like to do?</p>
      
      <hr/>
      
      <p>Players will likely split up, following their own threads. With any luck, Kerrin will go to investigate the rumors of 
      plague - she will find seveal delerious Eldrani soldiers disguised as roving tradesmen looking for work at the local 
      infirmary, being tended to by an elderly woman named Kass, detailed <a href="whitelake-infirmary.html">here</a>.</p>
      
      <p>Crom, from his note, will likely go in search of an Eldrani contact. He will find Alliver Percel, a local weaver and 
      purveyor of fine linens who is a deepcover Eldrani agent placed on this side of the Channel, outlined 
      <a href="percels-shoppe.html">here</a>.</p>
      
      <p>With little else to go with, Abi, Mike, and Amanda will likely head to the local inn and brewhouse, the 
      <em>Rose and Barrel</em> where they will encounter a few colourful characters with plot hooks for them to investigate, 
      described <a href="rose-and-barrel.html">here</a>.</p>
