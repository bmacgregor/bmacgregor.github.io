      <p class="h4"><strong>Kerrin's Thread : Whitelake Infirmary</strong></p>
      <p><em>You locate the infirmary, a squat, whitewashed building on the fringes of town. Stepping through the door, you're 
      reminded of your old life, working in the royal hospital of Marris and later, acting as personal healer for Traem, the 
      ailing King of the realm who - under your careless attentions - was murdered.</p>
      
      <p>A tired looking woman glances up from her patient - the room features six beds, all of which are in use; their 
      occupants in what appear to be the extremely late stages of a deadly fugue. They are covered in sweat, despite the chill of 
      the room, and their skin has taken on a pallid tone. One of their number babbles incoherently, while another begs for 
      water, his tone wavering between lost and shrill.</p>
      
      <p>You've seen these symptoms before. This is what killed your King.</p>
      
      <p>The old woman clears her throat, </em>"can I be of assistance, master..?"</p>
      
      <hr/>
      
      <p>The caretaker, Adra, fears that her patients are plague-carriers. In fact, they've been bitten by Snow Spiders, and are 
      suffering from the same deadly poison that ended Traem's life. In fact, it was their group who obtained the poison used to 
      slay the elderly King, orchestrated by Baelin Drannis for his Eldrani masters. The six here are the last survivors of the 
      expedition, and not long for this world. They managed to pass the poison they extracted from the dead spider at the warren 
      to another Eldrani agent, who took the virulent poison into the capital city of Marris to deliver it to Baelin, who then 
      had Kerrin unwittingly administer the fatal dose to the King.</p>
      
      <p>Adra will explain that she's used all sorts of medicinal herbs - motherswart, kindlingroot, and sweethistle to no avail. 
      Nothing she's tried seems to help her poor charges, who were found on the outskirts of town. She assumes they're tradesmen, 
      taken to the road, and unfortunate enough to catch some awful sickness.</p>
      
      <p>On inspection, bite-marks can be found, which Adra had covered with bandages, assuming they were simple cuts that the men 
      sustained as they dragged themselves through the trees in the forest. Adra knows about Snow Spiders, but there hasn't been 
      an attack in years - typically, the spiders hunt small game in the forest, and the Whitelake-folk know better than to go 
      looking for such trouble; she's certainly never seen the effects of the poison they carry in their fangs.</p>
      
      <p>At times, some of the men stray into a language that Kerrin can almost identify, but it's slurred due to the poison and 
      drugs that Adra's given the men. If Crom is brought to the infirmary, he'll recognize it as Eldrani.</p>
      
      <p>Adra knows a little about Palisin - she thinks he's add odd, but clever man who comes into town for supplies, but 
      doesn't stay long. She admires his dilligence for his work, but as she's been tending the sick for the last week, she 
      doesn't know if he's been in Whitelake.</p>
      
      <hr/>
      
      <p>Once the bites are discovered and discussed, read the following:</p>
      
      <p><em>If these men are suffering from the same poison that killed the King, an anti-toxin might be made by tracking down 
      the creature responsible and extracting a small amount of its poison. Once you have the venom, you believe you could 
      make a remedy by injecting a small amount of it into an animal, and later, taking the blood from the infected 
      creature.</p>
      
      <p>Your medical knowledge tells you that to treat such a sickness, it's best to use an anti-toxin generated by the same 
      animal - in this case, that would mean a human volunteer - but due to the deadly nature of the poison, this might be out 
      of the question. Time, you also reflect, is not on your side, but perhaps you could study the effects of the poison that 
      you believe killed the King. That would mean, however, likely allowing these men to die.</p>
      
      <p>A question tugs at your analytical mind. How did a group of tradesmen come into contact with the same toxin that 
      killed your King, and labelled you a traitor to your country? The men are nearly out of their minds, gibbering in a 
      foreign tongue. Perhaps if you can find out what language they speak, you might be able to gain some insight.</em></p>
