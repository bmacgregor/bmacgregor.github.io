      <p class="h4"><strong>Kerrin's Thread : Whitelake Infirmary</strong></p>
      <p><em>You locate the infirmary, a squat, whitewashed building on the fringes of town. Stepping through the door, you're 
      reminded of your old life, working in the royal hospital of Marris and later, acting as personal healer for Traem, the 
      ailing King of the realm who - under your careless attentions - was murdered.</p>
      
      <p>A tired looking woman looks up from her patient - the room features six beds, all of which are in use; their 
      occupants in what appear to be the extremely late stages of a deadly fugue. They are covered in sweat, despite the chill of 
      the room, and their skin has taken on a pallid tone. One of their number babbles incoherently, while another begs for 
      water, his tone wanering between lost and shrill.</p>
      
      <p>You've seen these symptoms before. This is what killed the King.</p>
      
      <p>The old woman clears her throat, </em>"can I be of assistance, master..?"</p>
      
      <hr/>
      
      <p>The caretaker, Adra, fears that her patients are plague-carriers. In fact, they've been bitten by snow-spiders, and are 
      suffering from the same deadly poison that ended Traem's life. In fact, it was their group who obtained the poison used to 
      slay the elderly King, orchestrated by Baelin Drannis for his Eldrani masters. The six here are the last survivors of the 
      expidition, and not long for this world. They managed to pass the poison they extracted from the dead spider at the warren 
      to another Eldrani agent, who took the virulent poison into the capital city of Marris and deliver it to Baelin, who then 
      has Kerrin administer the fatal dose to the King.</p>
      
      <p>Adra will explain that she's used all sorts of medicinal herbs - motherswart, kindlingroot, and sweethistle to no avail. 
      Nothing she's tried seems to help her poor charges, who were found on the outskirts of town. She assumes they're tradesmen, 
      taken to the road, and unfortunate enough to catch some awful sickness.</p>
      
      <p>On inspection, bitemarks can be found, which Adra had covered with bandages, assuming they were simple cuts that the men 
      sustained as they dragged themselves through the trees in the forest. Adra knows about Snow Spiders, but there hasn't been 
      an attack in years - typically, the spiders hunt small game in the forest, and the Whitelake-folk know better than to go 
      looking for such trouble.</p>
      
      <p>At times, some of the men stray into a language that Kerrin can almost identify, but it's slurred due to the poison and 
      drugs that Adra's given the men. If Crom is brought to the infirmary, he'll recognize it as Eldrani.</p>
      
      <p>Once the bites are discovered and discussed, read the following:</p>
      
      <p><em>If these men are suffering from the same poison that killed the king, and anti-toxin might be made by tracking down 
      the creature responsible and extracting a vial of its poison. Once you have the vemon, you believe you could make a remedy by 
      injecting a small amount of the poison into an animal, and later, withdrawing a small amount of blood from the infected 
      creature. Your medical knowledge tells you that to treat such a sickness, it's best to use anti-toxin generated by the same 
      animal - in this case, that would mean a human volunteer - but due to the deadly nature of the poison, this might be out of 
      the question. Time, you also reflect, is not on your side, but perhaps you could study the effects of the poison that you 
      believe killed the king.</em></p>
