      <p>While Farstin is distracting Abi and Amanda, Hamptish and Dolan will talk with Mike about their ill-luck. They will 
      explain that they are two merchants, on their way from Alvelin - a small Eldrani city known for its fine glasswares - to 
      Marris when they were robbed on the road. The bandits held themselves "much like you do, m'lord - a man with a background in 
      campaigning. A soldier." The two of them were wondering if perhaps Mike is the bandit's former commander, and if he is, that 
      he can find them "along the road, only a few leagues from Whitelake itself, sir."</p>
      
      <p>If Mike says he's not their former commander, the merchants will fall over themselves attempting to apologize. They just 
      thought that if the men were former soldiers, it doesn't bode well for the Bastard and his war, and certainly not his 
      name, if his men are turning bandit and deserting. Or maybe the Bastard himself has given up on winning Eldran, and is 
      turning his army loose on the countryside before marching on Marris to take the crown by force...</p>
