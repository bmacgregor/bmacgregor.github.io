			<p><em>Returning to Percel's Tapestry and Fine Linen's, you find the weaver much as you left him. This 
			time, however, he sets his work aside at your entrance and gives you his full attention.</p>
			
			<p></em>"The bolt,"<em> he says, gesturing to the front door, and while you lock up, he fumbles with a few 
			objects on his desk in the corner of the room. Eventually he finds a key, which he uses to unlock the 
			adjoining room, which he ushers you through quickly, throwing a furtive glance over his shoulder before 
			shutting you both into what you assume is his study.</p>
			
			<p>The room itself is cluttered with all manner of things - maps and books, a sheaf of papers that look 
			like translations of one language or another, several chests with more documents spilling freely onto the 
			floor, and a large hearth at the end of the room which Percel gestures to you to fill with some nearby 
			kindling.</p>
			
			<p>You take a few moments to start a fire, warmth blooming in the chill room. Percel has settled into a 
			plush chair in one of the rooms corners, after idly dragging a threadbare stool out from somehwere, 
			presumably for you to sit on.</em> "Well?" <em> He says, tercely, </em>"give me your report."</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p>As last time, Percel will treat Crom's Character as expendible and barely above his notice. The 
			conversation will likely be full of minor slights, and Percel will no doubt chastize Crom for not having 
			solved the cypher yet. He will also inquire about the livlihood of the poisoned men, and demand Crom do something 
			about them "before we are given away by the fools."</p>
			
			<p>When Crom has solved at least part of the letter, this is continued 
			<a href="a-choice-of-two-paths.html">here</a>.</p>
