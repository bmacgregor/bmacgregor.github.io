			<p><em>The place is much as you left it, seven opening that receed into the darkness of the earth found in a small 
			clearing. Two of the caves are fairly large, while the others would be tight indeed to squeeze through. You doubt that 
			you would have much room to swing your weapons freely, though stabbing and thrusting would probably serve you in the 
			cramped quarters.</em></p>
			
			<p>If the Players arrive at the nest around nightfall, the monstrous snow spider will be out hunting, and unlikely to 
			return for some time. The Players will have to contend with her nine younglings, however, which are active in the 
			heart of the cavern. All of the "arms" of the cavern join up in the centre, where the Players will be able to find 
			four dead Eldrani soldiers, identifiable by their shields and armour, though only Crom will know what house they come 
			from and their purpose in the hive.</p>

	exoskeleton that protects it like hardened leather (1 Piercing & Cleaving). Its murderous poison has a
