			</ul>
			<p>Once this is done and the Players have read their notes, read the following:</p>
			
			<div class="panel-body bg-warning">
				<p><em>You and your companions have left the carnage of the Church Knight's convoy behind, letting 
				the enraged hounds make short and bloody work of their former masters. The old man, Hedeg, 
				hobbles through the snow with the five of you, somehow keeping pace despite his blindness, 
				although, in the dark of the forest you own sight is little better than his, you suppose.</em></p>
				
				<p><em>After walking some distance through the night, one of your number lights a torch so that you 
				can study your stolen map, pilfered from the wagon where your stolen equipment was found. Recalling 
				the events of your escape, you shudder at the memory of the awful Iron Cauldron, large enough for 
				a man to stand in, and covered in profane images of some lost civilization. You can almost feel the 
				unnatural chill the accursed object bled into the night; an insidious cold that was as unlike a 
				winter's frost as the noontide sun's light is to a guttering candle.</em></p>
				
				<p><em>The old man coughs, breaking your reverie.</em> "Whitelake," <em>he croaks, stabbing a finger 
				at the stolen map and somehow pointing to a labeled dot.</em> "that's where we're bound. East."</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>Here are a few things to remind the Players of at this point:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Although they stole some supplies from the Church Knight's baggage train, it's nowhere near 
				enough to get them to civilization</li>
				<li>It's midwinter, and they have precious little in the way of actual survival gear</li>
				<li>The only nearby place where they might find more gear to furnish a journey to somewhere like 
				Marris (the capital) is Whitelake</li>
				<li>The map, based on where Hedeg's pointed shows them quite close to the Eldrani border; anyone
				with a history with the war can assume that this territory will probably be contested - if not 
				now, then likely soon</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Allow the Players to RP and deliberate as they like - this is, after all, an intro and meant to get 
			them back into the spirit of the game. Once they're ready to move on, part two can be found 
			<a href="spider-warren.html">here</a>.</p>
