	<div class="container text-justify">
		<div class="panel-body">
			<p class="h4"><strong>The Sunken Temple</strong></p>
			<p><em>You travel, following Farstin's direction. Though drunk, you're surpised at how accurate the 
			landmarks and estimates of distance are; it appears that your inebriated friend has a knack for 
			accuracy.</p>
			<p>Several hours pass, as you and your companions march through the winter wilds, and eventually, you 
			find the narrow pass that Farstin mentioned. Following it for a few hundred yards, it widens gradually. 
			The snow underfoot crackles with every step, and you realize that the ground is littered with bones - 
			at first, hardly enough to cause alarm, but as you progress, there seems to be more - hundreds, if 
			not thousands or shards, bleached by the sun and weathered by the cold. The ravine finally ends - 
			progress blocked by a grotto, sunken into the earth.</p>
			
			<p>The scene before is a strange one - standing in the centre of the grotto is a massive stone obelisk, 
			riddled with intricate carvings like the ones Farstin drew for you back in the Rose and Barrel - the 
			runes spiral outward, giving the towering pillar an ominous feeling as it looms over you. Set around it, 
			you notice a large number of curious stones, some of which appear to be placed on obvious pressure 
			plates. As you study the area closer, you count eleven plates in all - each roughly five feet in size, 
			circling the base of the obelisk. Most strangely, on what should be the twelfth plate, there is instead 
			an odd sort of implement, shaped like a rod, embedded into the ground, topped with two arms, like a 
			letter 'T'.</p>
			
			<p>Turning your attention to the pressure plates, you see a small stone placed atop the plate to the rods
			immediate right. The next two plates are empty, but a larger rock sits on the corner pad. Another larger 
			stone is on the plate next to this, with three of the small stones put on top of it, in what looks to be 
			a deliberate placement. The next two pads are, again, skipped, and there are several stones on the 
			following plate - two massive stones set on top of one another in a pillar-like column with two more of 
			the "medium sized" stones on top of this, and a further four of the smaller stones topping the entire 
			bizarre column, all of which seem to be placed deliberately as well.</p>
			
			<p>On the plate following this large column, there is a single massive stone, and on the last pad, 
			nothing.</p>
			
			<p>Casting around the grotto, you spot more of the stones, all corresponding to the three sizes already
			present on the plates. In all, you count twenty-five of the smallest blocks of which eight are on 
			the pads, fifteen of the medium-sized stones with five of those placed on the pressure pads, and fifteen 
			of the massive stones, with two of these on the pads already.</em></p>
	
			<hr/>
	
			<p>To solve the puzzle, the players will need to arrange the stones to match the correct number of the 
			fibbonacci sequence that the pad belongs to and then turn the "key" - or in this case, the rod. The 
			correct sequence is:</p>
	
			<p><strong>0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89</strong></p>
	
			<p>The largest of the stones are worth ten units, the medium stones are worth five, and the smallest 
			blocks represent a single unit each. The count of stones, however, is meant to leave eighteen units 
			left over - not all of the blocks will be used! This is meant as a nasty red-herring for OCD 
			Players.</p>
	
			<p>If the players set up the puzzle with the <em>incorrect</em> number of stones on any given pad 
			<strong> and turn the key</strong>, a trap will activate. The bones will shudder and swirl, and a 
			skeleton will form itself and attack the Players. At first, the number of skeletons raised will be 
			small – in fact, on the first failed attempt, none will raise to impede the Characters’ progress. On 
			successive failures, however, the number of skeletons will equal the number of failed attempts the 
			Players have accrued, based on the Fibonacci sequence.</p>
	
			<p>That is to say; if the Players have failed one time, no skeletons are raised since the first number 
			in the sequence is 0.  The key will turn in the lock, but will get stuck, and a light will flash, 
			indicating that something is happening, but nothing actually does.</p>
	
			<p>If the Players continue, but fail (their second failure) and turn the key, the light flashes again, 
			and a single skeleton is spawned (the second number in the sequence being 1).  If they fail a third 
			time, another single skeleton is raised (the third number also being one in the sequence), and so on, 
			so by the twelfth failure, 89 skeletons are raised and will most likely slay the Characters, should 
			they be foolish enough to stay and fight.</p>

			<p>The trap aspect of the entrance resets once every 24 hours, but can also revolve past the final 
			position, so by either waiting a full day or by somehow dealing with 89 skeletons, the new summon-total 
			is back at zero.  Similarly, the skeletons remain animated for 24 hours, or until they are 
			destroyed.</p>
	
			<p>Once the Players have successfully completed the puzzle, the obelisk shudders, and unseen gears 
			grind to life - slowly, the tower descends into the earth, segmenting as it lowers deep underground, 
			and creating a staircase for the Players to follow, if they so choose.</p>
