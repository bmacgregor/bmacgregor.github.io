			<p><em>You travel, following Farstin's direction. Though drunk, you're surpised at how accurate the 
			landmarks and estimates of distance are; it appears that your inebriated friend has a knack for 
			accuracy.</p>
			<p>Several hours pass, as you and your companions march through the winter wilds, and eventually, you 
			find the narrow pass that Farstin mentioned. Following it for a few hundred yards, it widens gradually. 
			The snow underfoot crackles with every step, and you realize that the ground is littered with bones - 
			at first, hardly enough to cause alarm, but as you progress, there seems to be more - hundreds, if 
			not thousands or shards, bleached by the sun and weathered by the cold. The ravine finally ends - 
			progress blocked by a grotto, sunken into the earth.</em></p>
