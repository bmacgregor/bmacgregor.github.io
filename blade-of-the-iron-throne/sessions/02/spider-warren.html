      <p class="h4"><strong>The Spider Warren</strong></p>
      <p><em>You and your group wander rougly eastward, using the starts as a guide, the frosted snows cracking underfoot as you 
      wind your way toward Whitelake. You've been marching steadily for a few hours, and dawn is fast approaching. The forest has 
      gradually been thinning, giving way to rolling plains of the far east of Fornholm and its uneasy border with Eldran, across 
      the Weeper's Channel. You trudge past another hip-deep snowdrift and through the trees, and find yourself in an odd clearing, 
      full of strange cave-like openings, almost large enough for a man to walk through. In all, there are seven of these caves, 
      with two of them noticably larger than the rest.</em></p>
      
      <p>Ask the Players what they would like to do. Have any Player with the Precognition skill roll it now, without an 
      explanation. A single sucess gives them an extremely uneasy feeling, and a strong suggestion not to explore the caves unless 
      they have a good reason to do so.</p>
      
      <p>If the Players look around the area, they will notice several sacks, the size of a child's head. These sacks are pale 
      white and nearly translucent, and lie discarded by a copse of trees in the clearing. There are nine of these sacks.</p>
      
      <p>For the most part, the entranceways are too tight to properly accomodate swinging attacks. Thrusts, the Players expect, 
      would work, but any attempt at mobiliy while inside the smaller caves is impossible, unless they open up to a larger area 
      somewhere below.</p>
      
      <hr/>
      
      <p>If the Players enter the caves and squeeze their way underground, they can hear odd, chittering calls, and the clicking 
      of what sounds like metal on the earthen walls. If they've brought a torch with them, eventually, they will make out the 
      gleam of polished gems that flicker and dance in the firelight, and vanish suddenly. This is the fire relfected back at the 
      Player from their own torch, shining into the eyes of the young spiderlings that inhabit the underground cavern. The 
      newborns shy away from the fire, and if a Player hastens to catch them, they will find themselves in a large central 
      chamber. Although this area is much larger, and the Player could freely swing even a Greatsword here, it will probably 
      be a hapless Character's tomb, as this is where the newborn spiders have fled, for the protection of their mother - a 
      full-fledged Queen. She is monstrous in size.</p>
      
      <p>Also in the central chamber, the Players will find four human corpses bearing the heraldry of House Garont, a minor 
      Eldrani lordling and a second, dead monstrous spider - the Queen's mate. Currently, the Queen is asleep (she hunts at night, 
      and it's close to dawn) but attacking her young, remaining in the burrow for a significant amount of time, making noise, 
      or attacking her will certainly awaken her considerable wrath.</p>
      
      <p>If an enterprising Player manages to attack a fleeing newborn before reaching the central chamber, the entire colony 
      will rise up to attack. They might achieve this by using a ranged weapon on a youngling, but Players are inventive, and 
      there are many ways that the spider hive could be attacked. Use your best judgement. The Queen will emerge using one of the 
      two large openings, and the younglings will pour out of the cavern from anywhere. Two are able to move through the same area 
      at once.</p>
      
      <p>The Queen uses the Monstrous Spider's stats, while the younglings are smaller *the size of a child) and are less armoured 
      (1 Piercing & Cleaving). Their poison is not as potent (QoS 2), and they use small fangs.</p>
      
      <p>Spider poison can be milked and studied by an apothecary, and may provide some clues as to the death of the king 
      (see Kerrin's thread - <em>A Sickening Population</em>). Crom's character will definitely recognize the heraldry of the 
      dead men, and Kerrin's Character will surely wonder at the presence of dead men in a place where virulent poison exists...</p>

      <p>Moving on from the Spider Warren, the Players make it to Palisin's deserted home, which is detailed
