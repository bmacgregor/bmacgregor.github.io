      			<p><em>You awaken from what feels like the shortest of sleeps. Your joints ache from resting on the wooden 
      			floor. The others are rousing from their sleep and look equally stiff - Hedeg, it seems, has been awake 
      			for some time; his craggy features looking gaunt and withered. Noticing that you're awake, he grunts and 
      			motions toward a nearby table that he's put some dried meat on.</em> "Found that in the cellar,"<em> he 
      			rumbles by way of explanation, and pauses for a moment, considering what to say next.</em><p>
      				
      			<p>"I'll be of no use to you lot in Whitelake, but I think that's where you ought to be headed,"<em>he 
      			says.</em> "Those folk are superstitious, and someone like me wouldn't be welcomed with open arms. I need 
      			another favour from you."<em> He almost looks sheepish as he says this, and casts his milky eyes 
      			floorward.</em> "I didn't forsee this, and it's troubling to me not to find Palisin here. I know I've kept 
      			you in the dark, but I'll answer what questions you might have of me if you help me find him."</p>
      			
      			<p>Is there anything you want to ask Hedeg?</p>
      			
      			<hr/>
      			
      			<p>Hedeg is willing to admit a few things to the Players. Foremost, that he is a seer, and that he allowed 
      			himself to be labelled as a heretic so that the Church Knights would capture him. He had forseen an event 
      			that would bring the Players together, and conspired to place himself in their paths. If asked, he's not 
      			entirely sure why - his visions come and go, occlouded by the mists of a handful of possible futures, but 
      			in each of them, the Players hold a prominent role - their destinies are entwined, and burn like 
      			dragonsfire.</p>
      			
      			<p>Hedeg knows a little about Lost Naivunnan - a dead culture that vanished into a fissure in reality a 
      			thousand years ago, and can feel their world writhing towards his own, desperate to regain a foothold in 
      			this plane of existence. The Iron Cauldron the Players saw was one of their artifacts, and there are more,
      			lost for centuries, and now finding their way back into the hands of man.</p>
      			
      			<p>If they ask, Palisin is an Archivist; he studies lost and dead civilizations in an attempt to unlock 
      			their secrets. He doesn't know how to get into the Doorless Tower, but thinks that if he remains here, 
      			he might be able to uncover some clue as to what happened to Palisin. He had hoped to speak to his old 
      			friend about his fears, and consult his records on Naivunnan. Unfortunately, with Palisin lost, he will 
      			have to try to learn what he can on his own.</p>
      			
      			<p>Be creative with Hedeg's responses. He doesn't know what the signifigance of the headdress is, and is 
      			unsure if it's a Naivunnan artifact, but suggests the Players be wary of any items of the like - such 
      			carvings are unnatural, and Hedeg instinctively distrusts anything that needs to be worn about the head, 
      			face, or neck.</p>
      			
      			<hr/>
      			
      			<p>Once the Players have asked their questions, heading into Whitelake is detailed
