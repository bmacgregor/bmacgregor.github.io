			<p class="h4"><strong>The Missing Archivist</strong></p>
			<p><em>Another hour's travel brings the dawn and the weariness of a night's trek through the wintry 
			forest. The trees have thinned even further, and you march doggedly across wind-lashed plains. Cresting a 
			small hummock, you get your first view of Whitelake, set on the shores of the Weeper's Channel. Hedeg casts 
			about, using his quarterstaff as a crutch.</em></p>
			
			<p>"We're close - I can smell it in the air." <em>He says, </em>"Palisin lives on the outskirts - not one 
			that likes too many people about. Look for a hut and a small tower."</em></p>
			
			<p><em>You spot what the old man describes, and resume your half-hearted trudge. Palisin's house, 
			it seems, is a ramshackle hut, nominally a part of Whitelake by proximity, but may as well be in the 
			wilderness. Little care has been taken of the property - the drifts are as high here as anywhere else, 
			and you're sure that in the spring, the grounds are choked with weeds. Despite this, Hedeg seems 
			excited at the prospect of seeing his friend, and breaks into a shaky trot as you come close.</em></p>
			
			<p><em>Oddly enough, you don't see any smoke rising from the prominent chimney, and the hut looks dark 
			inside. The closer you come to the place, the less inhabited it seems.</em></p>
			
			<p>What would you like to do?</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p>Palisin, indeed, isn't here. If the Players enter his home (which is unlocked), evidence of a struggle 
			is everywhere - knocked over plates, a scattered meal that the rats have been at on the floor, and papers 
			with bizarre glyphs strewn across the main room. It's obvious that the place has been ransacked; from 
			the looks of it, the event probably happened a few days ago at the most.</p>
			
			<p>Let the Players explore around. The tower - adjacent to the hut - is firmly locked, with no signs of 
			how someone might enter it - in fact, it doesn't appear to have a door. The Players can certainly climb 
			it, though the roof is capped. The top floor has a set of narrow windows - a kind of purple glass inset 
			with iron frames - and through these, a Player climbing to the top level would be able to make out a madcap 
			assortment of alchemical instruments, a large wall of vellum books, and several strange pieces of jewelry on 
			a desk. The windows are too narrow for a Player to squeeze through.</p>
			
			<p>The Players will undoubtedly find a bizarre piece of jewelry in their search of the hut - what appears 
			to be some kind of headdress that fastens with a clasp behind the wearer's head, just where the neck meets 
			the skull. The piece appears to be made of a pale gold metal, and features bizarre nautical carvings - 
			waves that turn in on themselves, shaped with impossible precision and detail, and creatures with dozens 
			of eyes that swim along the golden depths of the headdress.</p>
			
			<p>Any Player attempting to put the headdress on will be scolded by Hedeg, saying that they should know 
			enough to leave such things alone. If they ignore his warnings, nothing much will happen. Wearing the 
			headdress in town will cause a few locals to react strangely to the Player, and the longer it is worn, 
			the more likely that this Player will be sought out by the Naivunnan Wights, encounted late in this 
			session.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p>Once it becomes clear that the Players aren't going to find Palisin just by standing around, Hedeg 
			will suggest they get some rest and investigate the village once everyone's had some sleep. If they 
			agree, the next part can be found <a href="questions-and-bargains.html">here</a>.</p>
