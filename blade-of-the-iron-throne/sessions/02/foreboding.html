			<p><em>The cavern opens up to a strange room, carved into the rock. The dimensions seem deliberate, 
			even to your untrained eye, as if the room was created with a specific purpose in mind. Other than 
			a pedestal in the centre of the chamber with an odd object on it, the room is empty. Given how 
			untouched it appears, you guess that the Wights avoided this place.</em></p>
			
			<p><em>At the far end of the room is a pair of doors.</em></p>
			
			<hr>
			
			<p>A mask rests on the pedestal, and the doors lack a place for a keyhole. As such, it can't be 
			picked, and is impervious to bashing. To unlock the doors, one of the players will have to put on the
			mask. Doing this will allow the sprit that resides in the mask to interact with the Players through 
			the Character wearing it.</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p>Once a Player chooses to wear the mask:</p>
			
			<p><em>Something foreign invades your mind.</em></p>
			
			<p>Send the player this note, to be read aloud:</p>
			
			<p>https://bmacgregor.github.io/blade-of-the-iron-throne/sessions/notes/the-masks-riddle.html</p>
			
			<p>Once the Players solve the Masks riddle (the answer being <strong>a keyhole</strong>), the Character 
			wearing the mask will witness the pillar disapear. In its place is a key. Turning to the doors while 
			wearing the mask now will reveal a keyhole that only the mask-wearer can see. Until the riddle is 
			solved, the mask cannot be removed.</p>
