			<p><em>One by one, your patients die - far too gone for your antivenom to do anything beyond make their 
			passing a little easier, but the last, a young man who looks barely older than seventeen, clings to his 
			life fiercely. Although his colour is waxy, and he still had a fever, you believe that he may actually 
			survive his order. He sleeps fitfully, tossing and turning in his small cot.</p>
			
			<p>Adra has been away for a little while, getting some well deserved rest, you expect, and the room feels 
			empty with only you and the sickly youth in it. You're making notes in a new journal, your old one long 
			gone; confiscated after your arrest, when you hear a rasping voice, hardly louder than a whisper.</p>
			
			<p>Looking up, you realize your patient is once again delirious. This time though, his words are clearer - 
			his tone is less muddled by a swollen tongue, and you realize that he is speaking in a different language, 
			one that you can finally place.</p>
			
			<p>It's Eldrani.</em></p>
			
			<p>"Father..." <em>the youth calls weakly. </em>"I can't see, Father. Are you there? Am I home?"</em> He 
			continues in Eldrani.</p>
			
			<p>What do you want to do? Adra is likely going to be away for a while; do you want to try and find out 
			who this young man is?</p>
			
			<hr/>
			
			<p>Fooling the delirious youth is hardly difficult. He's been blinded by the poison, but will most likely 
			survive. He will ask a few things before passing into unconciousness - first, if Traem is dead, and if 
			their mission succeeded. He will want to know if he brought honour to House Garont, and if their debts with 
			Roberre is finally paid. He will want to know if the sword can be reforged. Once he's said a few things, 
			unless Kerrin wants to probe beyond this, he will fall unconcious.</p>
			
			<p>Kerrin then receives this note to wrap up her thread:
