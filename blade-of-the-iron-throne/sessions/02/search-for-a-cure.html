			<p>First off, Kerrin has to figure out how to create (and then administer) her antitoxin. Although 
			Whitelake doesn't have a holstery, there are some places where small livestock can be found - the inn is 
			one such place, having a pair of goats and some chickens. Though the proprietor, Ranek, will be none too 
			happy about having one of his goats poisoned, but will grudgingly allow Kerrin to use one to make an 
			antivenom. Plague, he will reason, is bad for business, but "if you kill 'em, or ruin their cheese, 
			there'll be hell to pay" he warns.</p>
			
			<p>Creating an antitoxin will require two Apothecary successes, will take a day to create (though Kerrin 
			can leave a goat in either Redek or Adra's charge in her absence), and should cure one of the survivors - 
			the remaining five are too far gone to be saved (and, they may have been killed by Cromwell before now).</p>
			
			<p>If Kerrin does manage to save one of the men, her thread for Whitelake continues 
			<a href="house-garonts-involvement.html">here</a>, otherwise, this is the note she gets:
