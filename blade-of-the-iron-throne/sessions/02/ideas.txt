Scene One: The Forest
	Short
	Meant to re-establish tone/recall Players to their situation
	Remind Players about the Cauldron; this will come into play later in the campaign (probably?)
	Emphasize that while they looted some stuff, they don't have enough to make it any great distance overland in the winter
	After some discussion, have Hedeg suggest travel to Whitelake - he knows someone there who may be of help

Scene Two: Spider Warren
	Dovetails into Forest scene
	Players are near Whitelake, after travelling for a few hours through the forest
	Find odd looking caves - holes in the ground, almost man-sized
	Hard to see unless the players step into it, but on the ground is a burst round, silken sack, so pale that it blends in with the snows
	Investigating the "caves" - the snow spider burrow, is a really bad idea
	The spiders are currently asleep, but it's pitch black in the caves.  Also, it's so tight in there that swung attacks are impossible
		There are a few entryways that are large enough to accomodate swung attacks. These lead to the burrow's centre, and to the queen
	Bringing a torch will grant some vilibility, and the Players will see the spiders eyes reflected in the torch glow
	Because the young spiders are new-born, they shy back from the fire, but if the players try to fight, the spiders will definitely fight back
	If the players progress deeper into the warren, they will find the centre, and potentially awaken the spider queen. A bad idea.
		If the players attack the youngling spiders, the colony will rise up and attack them. In total, there are seven younglings and one queen 
		in this warren
	The queen uses monstrous spider stats
	The younglings are smaller, the size of a child, and are less armoured  (1 Piercing & Cleaving). Their poison is not as potent (QoS 2), 
		and they use small fangs
	Spider poison can be milked and studied by an apothecary, and may provide some clues as to the death of the king
