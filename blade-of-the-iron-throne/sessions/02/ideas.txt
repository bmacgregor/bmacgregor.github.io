Scene One: The Forest
	Short
	Meant to re-establish tone/recall Players to their situation
	Remind Players about the Cauldron; this will come into play later in the campaign (probably?)
	Emphasize that while they looted some stuff, they don't have enough to make it any great distance overland in the winter
	After some discussion, have Hedeg suggest travel to Whitelake - he knows someone there who may be of help

Scene Two: Spider Warren
	Dovetails into Forest scene
	Players are near Whitelake, after travelling for a few hours through the forest
	Find odd looking caves - holes in the ground, almost man-sized
	Hard to see unless the players step into it, but on the ground is a burst round, silken sack, so pale that it blends in with the snows
	Investigating the "caves" - the snow spider burrow, is a really bad idea
	The spiders are currently asleep, but it's pitch black in the caves.  Also, it's so tight in there that swung attacks are impossible
		There are a few entryways that are large enough to accomodate swung attacks. These lead to the burrow's centre, and to the queen
	Bringing a torch will grant some vilibility, and the Players will see the spiders eyes reflected in the torch glow
	Because the young spiders are new-born, they shy back from the fire, but if the players try to fight, the spiders will definitely fight back
	If the players progress deeper into the warren, they will find the centre, and potentially awaken the spider queen. A bad idea.
		If the players attack the youngling spiders, the colony will rise up and attack them. In total, there are seven younglings and one queen 
		in this warren
	The queen uses monstrous spider stats
	The younglings are smaller, the size of a child, and are less armoured  (1 Piercing & Cleaving). Their poison is not as potent (QoS 2), 
		and they use small fangs
	Spider poison can be milked and studied by an apothecary, and may provide some clues as to the death of the king
	At the centre of the warren are several corpses and a second, dead, monstrous arachnid.  Although these corpses have been mostly devoured, the 
		livery of the house of Garont - a minor Eldrani house - can be found; Crom's character will recognize the house colours and corresponding 
		heraldry. Wheels in Kerrin's character's head will start spinning at the presence of dead men in a place that holds such a virulent poison
		
	There are human tracks in the snow, and a skilled huntsman will note that it appears that more footprints go into the warren than come out 
		of it

Scene Three: Whitelake at Dawn
	Story Thread : Hedeg's contact - Lost Naivunnan arc
		The contact's home, a squat house on the outskirts of Whitelake, appears locked and deserted
		Hedeg is worried, and suggests the Characters attempt to force their way into the home, in case his friend is within
		Once the players find their way in, they will see signs of a struggle, but no one is in the house
		Hedeg suggests the Players rest while they can, clean up, and then move into town to try and uncover what happened here
			Hedeg will take up residence in the house until the players progress in their side-quests. This seems like a good place to get
			him out of the way, "researching" what happened to his contact, the Things Beneath the Ice, 
	
		Thread 1 : Sunken Temple (Abi / Amanda)
			At the inn, Farstin (a local drunkard) will regale any who choose to listen (or come too close) of a haunted tomb half a days ride from
				Whitelake that was worshipped by Kevanjan savages "afore we took the fire to them heathens". No one's managed to get inside the 
				damn thing - "sealed up tighter than an Eldran's arse" - but he's sure there's riches to be had.
			If questioned, Farstin will mention chilling blood-rituals that "them godless Kevanjans" used to partake in. Amanda will know this to be
				false - blood ritual is not part of any mainstream Kevanjan rite - but might be convinced to go when Farstin scribbles a few Kevanjan 
				runes which he's "seen with his own eyes, if ya don't believe me" - these runes, though poorly drawn - are for undeath, sickness, 
				and godhood
			While Whitelake is quite far from Kevanja, it's not impossible that the nomadic people would have made it this far east, but to build 
				something like a tomb - like what the drunk is describing - is highly unlikely. If they chose to entomb something so far from home,
				they must have had a good reason to do so
				
			THIS THREAD LEADS TO A DUNGEON, AND UNLOCKS ABI'S LIFEDRAIN ABILITY
		
		Thread 2 : A Sickening Population / Snow Spiders (Kerrin)
			A number of travellers have been afflicted with a terrible wasting sickness that is sure to kill them, without proper medical care
			The wise woman has tried pungent smokes and healing herbs, but to no effect, and fears that it is a plague
			On careful inspection, the wounded have been bitten by snow spiders, and are suffering the effects of their poison
			There are a half-dozen wounded, are most of them are raving at this point, jabbering nonsense, and sometimes switching into a language
				that none of the Whitelake locals can mark, but that Crom will surely recognize as Eldrani.  Mike will probably regonize it as well,
				and maybe Kerrin due to her education
			Their symptoms are strikingly similar to that of the late King, so this might bear some study
			An antivenom could perhaps be created, but the players would have to find what caused the poison in the first place
			The travellers were found on the outskirts of town, ominously close to the spider warren
		
		Thread 3 : The Bastard's Deserters / Bandits on the Road (Mike)
			Also found at the inn are a worn pair that look to be merchants. Down to their last copper, and low on luck, they eye anyone coming into
				the inn - anyone who looks armed, they will attempt to wave over.
			The pair were waylaid on the road by bandits, though not the normal sort - these moved with precision, instead of the usual swaggering 
				arrogance of the common highwayman. Whitelake isn't too far from the Eldrani border, so putting two and two together, it's possible
				that these bandits are deserters from the war, and if that's found out, will reflect badly on the Bastard, as well as any claim he 
				might have to the throne
			THERE NEEDS TO BE BIGGER PAYOFF / MOTIVATION HERE
		
		Thread 4 : Percel's Tapestry and Linen Shoppe / Eldrani Contact (Crom)
			Percel's Shoppe is off of the main street, and features a large, hanging sign out front. This sign, with is mostly unobtrusive, displays
				the wares of the shop - tapestries, but it contains a curious glyph, marking it as a safehouse for Eldrani spies.
			Percel will explain to Crom that there are several wounded Eldrani agents in town, and that they either need to be killed, to 
				avoid detection (they're raving and starting to lapse into their native tongue), or somehow spirited out of the town, though Percel
				thinks this option is incredibly unlikely
			Perhaps by convincing the townsfolk, who seem to be ready to believe it, that these men are carrying the plague, they might easily be
				gotten rid of?
