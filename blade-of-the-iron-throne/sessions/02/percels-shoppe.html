      <p class="h4"><strong>Percel's Shoppe</strong></p>
      <p><em>You wander Whitelake's side-streets, idly glancing through windows as you allow yourself to become familiar with the 
      haphazard setup of the village. After a time, you find yourself at the end of a quiet alley; to your left, there's an 
      abandoned holstery, but what catches your eye is the sign of the shop on your right. An unobtrusive weaver's shop that 
      displays an ornate sign above its door that simply reads</em> Percel.<em> Worked into the flowing vinework of the signs 
      metal, however, is a curious glyph that you recognize.</p>
      
      <p>This shop is a front, and having noticed the marking, you know it to be a place for Eldrani agents to meet in 
      secret.</p>
      
      <p>Entering the shop, you see a small man who sits at a loom. Rather than looking up from his tapestry, he continues to work 
      the pedals and sends his threads out with practiced ease, but calls out a greeting to you.</em></p>
      
      <p>What would you like to do?</p>
      
      <hr/>
      
      <p>Percel is an Eldrani agent, careful, but also worried. He knows that the men in the infirmary are dying, and he's been 
      by, dropping off a few blankets to Adra and observing the goings-on. He's caught a few of their lapses into Eldrani, and has 
      done his best to convince Adra and the rest of the townsfolk that they're plague carriers.</p>
      
      <p>Suggest to Crom that he must have some signal from his past to identify himself to other covert Eldrani - a greeting or a 
      phrase could work, or a riddle with a unique answer. Anything really; but allow him to come up with something interesting.</p>
      
      <p>Once Percel is confident that he can trust Crom, he will explain the situation, all the while continuing his weaving. 
      Based on how Crom introduced himself, Percel knows that he is of a much lower status - practically expendable - and will 
      take the role of a superior officer. He wants the dying men's demise to be sped up as much as possible before someone 
      suspects that they're Eldrani. Their silence could be bought in a few ways - burning down the infirmary with them inside 
      or maybe convincing the townsfolk that Crom is a skilled healer in his own right, and that the men are a dangerous health 
      hazard - plague carriers that need to be dispatched immediately.</p>
      
      <p>He will also explain that one of the men was carrying a letter, but he's been unable to get close enough to take it from 
      them - in fact, the letter is resting with one of the dead men in the spider's warren, but Percel doesn't know this. The 
      letter contains valuable information on troop movements that the Edlrani men intercepted from a Fornish courier and were 
      supposed to deliver to Percel so that he could decode it. In fact, this letter details Council of Lords troop movement - 
      information that Crom might find incredibly valuable if he intends on stymying their chances in the civil war...</p>
      
      <p>If Crom manages to search the men - alive or dead, he won't find anything. They came into town with no belongings. Percel 
      will reason that the courier's letter must be with the dead men still in the spider's warren, and will direct Crom there to 
      get the letter for him.</p>
      
      <p>If Crom thinks to ask about Palisin, Percel denies all knowledge. In all honesty, he cares little for the goings on 
      of Whitelake, seeing as how the town is going to be burned to the ground as soon as the Bastard and his pathetic 
      holding action is whipped screaming from Eldran. He will remind Crom that he now has better things to do than ask after 
      the whereabouts of a backwards hermit, and to get to the task at hand.</p>
