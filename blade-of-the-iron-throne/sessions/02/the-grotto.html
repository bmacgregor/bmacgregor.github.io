			<p><em>The air is thick down here, and the dark swallows the tiny light of your torch. Somewhere in the 
			distance you hear a faint rattle, the scruff of bare feet on the hard earth, and then a scream as a 
			dozen figures run into the flickering light, their eyes round with madness, and their skin pale and 
			taught with the sure signs of starvation. The wights let loose another horrible shriek, and immediately 
			attack.</em></p>

		<p>Once the players have defeated the Wights, they can explore the small underground cavern. It's littered with 
		old bones and refuse. The humanoid things that attacked them had clearly been here for some time, and their 
		bodies look centuries old. They clearly went insane from their imprisonment - if they were ever truly sane to 
		begin with.</p>
