      <p class="h4"><strong>Farstin's Tale</strong></p>
      <p>Farstin, though drunk, does have some interesting points to make. First of all, he knows where there's an odd old place 
      covered in Kevanjan markings that he found months ago, a dozen leagues from the village. Although he's unlikely to 
      say, he was poaching at the time - the land belongs to the crown, and is under the purview of the Council of Lords.</p>
      
      <p>The place gave him the chills, as he puts it, and he's been "a-drinkin ever since, if you follow my drift," winking 
      lasciviously at his audience. "Anyhow," he continues, "nobodies managed to get into it from what I seen. Mind, you might 
      not want to, what with them blood-rituals the dirty savages get up to - no offence, mind," he says to Amanda's Character. 
      "Sometimes, I like to get up to some pretty different stuff myself." He leers and leans forward, nearly falling off of his 
      stool, but somehow retains his balance, and casually puts an arm around Abi's shoulders to steady himself.</p>
      
      <p>To prove that he's not "lying, like some damn ape from Nohentep" (a country far to the east), Farstin will dip his hand 
      into a neighbours drink and sketch out a few glyphs that he saw - making an outline of "them shapes he seen when he was up 
      there. I got a mem'ry like a sage!" He will then draw out the Kevanjic runes for 'Ancients,' 'Undying,' and 'Breath'.</p>
      
      <p>Amanda's note at this point is: 
      https://bmacgregor.github.io/blade-of-the-iron-throne/sessions/notes/amanda/02/03-a-cryptic-tomb.html</p>
      
      <p>Abi's note is: https://bmacgregor.github.io/blade-of-the-iron-throne/sessions/notes/abi/02/02-the-fools-signs.html</p>
      
      <p>Amanda will know a few things - first, most Kevanjan tribes do not participate in blood ritual. If the runes are indeed 
      Kevanjan, they mark some sort of important site. Whitelake is quite a ways away from where her people roam, though it's not 
      impossible that the nomads could have made it this far south. If that's the case, whatever they put there they must have had
      a good reason to bring a truly amazing distance.</p>
      
      <p>This thread picks up at <a href="sunken-temple.html">the Sunken Temple</a>.</p>
      
      <p>If asked about Palisin, Farstin will become a little indignant. He tried telling the old man about what he found, but 
      was waved off. How can someone who has all those books not be interested in an old tomb?</p>
