						<small>The King is Dead.  Long Live the King.</small></p>
						
						<p>Old king Traem is dead, taken by a sickness that leeched both his strength and his wits.  His eldest son, 
						Artorin, was killed in a hunting accident â€“ thrown from his horse, and ravaged by the bear that he and his Dukes 
						had stalked for days.</p>
						
						<p>There is no surviving male heir to the throne of Marris, the Ivory City, capital of Fornholm, and troublingly, 
						none of the Dukes can recount <em>exactly</em> what took place on the morning of their prince's untimely demise. 
						Left in this power vacuum are a handful of key players; powerful and manipulative, each with their own agenda.
						
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Alistra Leandis</strong>, princess of the realm, last of her line, and Traem's only surviving 
							<em>legitimate</em> child.  Many see her as the rightful heir to the throne, though it's believed that her 
							attempts to save her father only worsened his condition.</li><br/>
							
							<li><strong>Ranulf of Lornaven</strong>, the King's illegitimate son, campaigning in distant Eldran. He is far 
							from the news of his father's death and his half-brother's accident, as well as the accusations of treason. 
							Perhaps conveniently so.</li><br/>
							
							<li><strong>Jerlix Fein</strong>, Lord Regent, whose appointment to office took place a mere week after the old 
							King's ailment was discovered by the Head Physiker, <strong>Baelin Drannis</strong>.  Backed by the powerful - 
							and powerfully corrupt - Council of Lords.</li><br/>
							
							<li><strong>Mother Sarevin Caesless</strong>, Head of the Gray Church, who would make the country an extension 
							of her holy - though brave and heretical souls would say, <em>twisted</em> - reign, hunting sorcerers with equal 
							parts fervor and madness.</li>
						</ul></p>
						
						<p>Yet, despite (or perhaps, because of) the intrigue and double-dealing taking place in the Ivory City of Marris, 
						it would be careless to discount the neighboring countries, many of which would pay dearly to see an expansion of 
						their own borders...</p>

							Hedeg, he calls himself; the old man whose eyes are milky white, misted by age and cataracts.  Yet, for all the 
							earthly things he cannot see, his gaze is chill and clear, unfettered by the lies mortals tell themselves...
						</p>
						<p>
							When you awoke in the wagon, the old man was there, regarding the lot of you in the dark of your shared cell.
						</p>
						<p>
							He does not hold himself as a low-born hermit ought, and when his sightless gaze sweeps over you, your skin 
							crawls.

						<small>The Unstoppable Call</small></p>
						<p>
							It's hardly uncommon for simple folk to tell hair-raising tales around their fires at night; great beasts that 
							stalk the dark, or trolls who drain the blood of the livestock they steal.  These are legends, told to keep off 
							the cold of long nights, and to keep the children in line.
						</p>
						<p>
							Tellings of the Fallen Legion are different - spoken in low tones so to not awaken their wrath; a hundred men 
							clad in night-gray armour who move and fight in absolute silence.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is said they are the risen dead.
