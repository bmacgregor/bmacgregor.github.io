		  <p><em>After glancing at your stolen map, you realize that you must be close to the Eldrani border and to the Bastard's 
		  War by proxy. It's unlikely that Ranfulf knows of his father's death, or the mud that the Council of Lords has been 
		  slinging to blacken his name. If you're going to help your old commander win his crown, you're going to need to make 
		  sure he knows what's going on in his country.</p>
		  <p>Whitelake, a small fishing village, is nearby - if you and your group push hard, you might be able to make it there by
		  daybreak. With any luck, they might have a courier there that could get word to Ranulf, and perhaps you might be able to 
		  stem the tide of rumors that threaten his credibility and his rightful inheritance.</em></p>
