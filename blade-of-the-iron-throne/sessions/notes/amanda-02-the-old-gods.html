		  <p><em>Kevanja; the Shattered Lands - home to the nomadic tribes of your people and their many Gods. Although you were 
		  stolen from your homeland, echoes of the Old Ones are all around you, for the tribes would go far and where they 
		  travelled, they would worship. Even here, in distant Fornholm, nearly at the border of Eldran, you can feel their 
		  call.</p>
		  <p>In the quiet of the forest, your wandering mind brushes something that your ancestors left behind - something 
		  they took with them, far from home, and buried here, though for good or ill you cannot tell. Your people have countless 
		  legends; perhaps you could uncover the truth of one if you so choose.</em></p>
