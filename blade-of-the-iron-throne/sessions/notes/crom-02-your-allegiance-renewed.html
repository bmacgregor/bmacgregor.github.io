		  <p><em>Although your freedom has been gained, your retribution against those that have wronged you - the nobility of 
		  Fornholm - has yet to begin. Based on where you are, barely across the Eldrani border, your quest will be of limited 
		  scope for the moment, however, this may be to your benefit.</p>
		  <p>It's possible that a contact could be found in the nearby village of Whitelake, though locating them may prove 
		  difficult. You do know that many spies use signals to communicate; signs or glyphs hidden in plain sight. Perhaps there 
		  might be a safe-house set up this close to the border, to assist Eldrani agents operate in enemy territory. You will have 
		  to keep an eye out for such an opportunity...</em></p>
