		  <p><em>Stepping into the central chamber, your eyes flick to the a number of human corpses littering the ground. 
		  Normally, such a sight would hardly raise an eyebrow, but </em>this<em> is different.</p>
		  
		  <p>You know these men.</p>
		  
		  <p>To be precise, you don't know their names. You've never met them, but you know them all the same. Their 
		  colours, muddled by grisly wounds, mark them as men of House Garont - a minor Eldrani lordling.</p>
		  
		  <p>These are your countrymen.  But why are they here? There are questions, it seems, that you need answers 
		  to.</em></p>
