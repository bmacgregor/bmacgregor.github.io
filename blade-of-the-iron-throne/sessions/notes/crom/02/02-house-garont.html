		  <p><em>Stepping into the central chamber, your eyes flick to a number of human corpses littering the ground. 
		  Normally, such a sight would hardly raise an eyebrow, but </em>this<em> is different, and causes you to start 
		  in recognition.</p>
		  
		  <p>You know these men.</p>
		  
		  <p>To be precise, you don't know their names. You've never met them, but you know them all the same. Their 
		  colours, muddled by grisly wounds, mark them as men of House Garont - a minor Eldrani lordling.</p>
		  
		  <p>These are your countrymen.</p>
		  
		  <p>How did they come to be here? On this side of the Weeper's Channel, to die in the lair of a maneating spider 
		  and fed to its children? Carefully, you look around the chamber, marking the floor. It appears that there are more 
		  footprints here than would be left by four men. So a few of Garont's men escaped this doom? There are questions, 
		  it seems, that you need answers to.</em></p>
