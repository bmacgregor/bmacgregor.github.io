Olmsday, Second of Erustide

My lord, we have sighted the Fallen Legion near the Aranis and are in pursuit, as instructed.  I have left Harkster and Jorrum’s 
regiments entrenched near Queensreach to deal with the peasantry.  Their own communiques will be arriving in the usual method.  
We will use the Red Boar.

Greetings – the time is set.  We will meet in Fallsbridge at midnight on the date of this missive, near the old shrine to 
Keradis to discuss the overthrow of the Princess and the Church.  You will know our company by their ruby earrings.  The rest of 
this message will be coded to throw off spies.

Your servant, Lancaster, Ninth Division.

The message is coded in an odd shift-cypher; the first and third parts are pieces of the same message, while the second 
paragraph is a trap, intended on luring the unwary into an ambush.  The date gives a clue on how to read the message - Olmsday 
is the third day of the week, and the first shift used in the cypher. The second indicates which paragraph is a false lead, and 
can be disregarded by those in the know.  It is also a three-shift cypher, and because it is easy to solve, it should be the 
first message a thief will find.  Indeed, because the real message also uses a shift of three steps, a spy is guaranteed to 
see the trap first.

Erustide is the sixth month.  To solve the complex cypher, every character is shifted down three steps. Then, every even 
character is shifted ANOTHER six steps to reveal the true message.

Finally, the date of the message - Olmsday, the Second of Erustide, is two weeks in the future.  This is also a clue as to 
how to solve the puzzle.
