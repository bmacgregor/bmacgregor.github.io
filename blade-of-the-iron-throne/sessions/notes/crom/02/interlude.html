		  <p><em>You dream of a coronation. You stand at the head of an enormous hall, elevated, and looking down at the crowd that 
      has gathered to witness your crowning. The room is impeccably decorated, the walls and pillars covered in beautful swirling 
      patters that depict the waters and your new people. Your subjects are gathered, and they stand in scores - their numbers 
      seemingly uncountable, almost too many for the massive hall to hold.</p>
      
      <p>Turning your back to them, you regard your crown - an ornate head dress with a clasp that appears to fasten at the base 
      of your skull. It is made of some sublime material; too pale to be gold, but nevertheless breath-taking, and features the 
      same intricate nautical carvings of the rest of the hall. Behind you, your people are breathless with anticipation, waiting 
      for you to take the crown and become their right and true ruler.</p>
      
      <p>Your hand glides through the water, fingers outstretched to touch the prize and claim your regency, but the dream begins 
      to fade. You find yourself drifting toward wakefulness, with thoughts of the head-dress swimming through your mind, and 
      the promise of the glory that waits for you, beneath the ice.</em></p>
