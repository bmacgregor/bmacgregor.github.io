		  <p><em>Just as Percel instructed, your dead kinsmen are here; four of them, bodies bloated and rotting in the dark, 
		  their shields emblazoned with the crest of house Garont - a minor Eldrani lordling. It's unlikely that any of 
		  your companions recognize the mark, a hawk on the wing, clutching a broken sword.</p>
		  
		  <p>Your eyes flick from the corpses to the spiders, each as large as a grapefruit, all huddled around one of their dead, 
		  a monstrous beast nearly the size of a child. You scan the corpses again, and notice a sheet of parchment tucked into a 
		  belt - surely this is the dispatch you were sent for!</p>
		  
		  <p>You will have to be quick if you intend on stealing the missive. Luckily, the spiderlings should distract your 
		  company long enough for you to pilfer it.</em></p>
