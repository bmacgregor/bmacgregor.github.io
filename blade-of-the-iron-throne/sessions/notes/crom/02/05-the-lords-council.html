		  <p><em>Alliver Percel is a fool, and his vainglory will be his undoing. This is not a message that has anything to do with 
		  the invasion. Instead, you have happened on something much more potent - troop movements and positions of the Council of 
		  Lords; the men whose destruction you have been chasing for years...</p>
		  
		  <p>This letter, you know, is but the first that you must now uncover to further your quest for revenge. The message lists 
		  names - Harkster, Jorrum, and Lancaster - generals, you suspect, and an inn - the Red Boar, a well known establishment a 
		  weeks travel from Whitelake, in the heart of High-hall - a city that you are passing well-familiar with, having lived there 
		  before your capture by the Church Knights.</p>
		  
		  <p>If you leave soon, you might be able to watch the inn for signs of couriers, and possibly glean more information on the 
		  Lords, and how you might better see to their undoing.</em></p>
