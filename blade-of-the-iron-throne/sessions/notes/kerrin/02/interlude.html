		  <p><em>You dream of a silver-gold doorway, outlined in mysterious glyhs. Far above, you can hear the brackish water lap 
      against the ice, and although you should be cold, you barely notice the chill at all. In fact, it seems that the doorway 
      is emenating warmth, bleeding it through the waters and into your being.<p>
      
      <p>You focus on the door, your thoughts feeling hazy and sluggish. Almost by chance, you notice the doorway begin to open. 
      The warmth pulses, and the hinges move soundlessly beneath the waves. The glyphs dance before your eyes, dazzling. 
      Promising ancient knowledge. You peer at them, trying to get closer.</p>
      
      <p>Something - your waking mind, perhaps - tugs at you in alarm. Long, sinuous fingers reach for you, impossibly slowly, 
      from the opening portal - the figure they belong to blessedly obscured by darkness. You somehow plunge away from the alien 
      being, arms and legs writhing in the frigid waters.</p>
      
      <p>Your lungs are suddenly on fire, and you gasp for air in desperation. You struggle for the surface, knowing full well 
      that all that will greet you there will be a solid wall of ice, but knowing that drowning is a kinder fate than meeting the 
      awful </em>thing<em> from beyond the door. Flailing madly, you careen into an unseen pillar, and feel your body falling...
      
      <p>You awaken, sprawled on the floor, your blankets entangled around your bound legs. Relief sets in almost immediately, 
      followed by an odd sensation on your chest.</p>
      
      <p>The silver-gold pendant, nestled under your clothes and next to your skin, gives off an otherworldly warmth. Holding 
      your breath, you're certain that you can feel it beat, nearly in time with your own heart.</em></p>
