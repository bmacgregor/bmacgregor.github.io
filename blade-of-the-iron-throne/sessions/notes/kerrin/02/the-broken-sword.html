		  <p><em>The young man loses conciousness, and you doubt that he will remember the damning conversation that has left you 
		  shaken. You now know who was responsible for the death of your King. House Garont, it seems, procured the poison, and Baelin 
		  Drannis ensured that you would be the instrument of your Lord's death. What's more, it is clear to you now that your former 
		  mentor must be in league with Eldran, and is possibly an agent of the Empire.</p>
		  
		  <p>Something the young man said worries you - his family's debt to Roberre, and if the broken sword might be mended... 
		  These are mysteries that you don't have answers for, but that your scholars mind tells you are important. You are still far 
		  too known in Marris to go there to do your research, but the city of High-hall has a large library. You might find more 
		  information there, amongst the stacks.</em></p>
