		  <p><em>You step into the central chambed, the air filled with the noxious stench of the dead. In the middle of the 
		  room are shapes that chitter angrily in the flickering torchlight, each as large as a grapefruit with sinuous legs. 
		  They huddle around a massive spider, almost the size of a child, though apparently dead. In one of the corners, you 
		  can make out a few human bodies with a strange emblem that you can't place, etched into their shields - a hawk on the 
		  wing, clutching a broken sword. Given your education, and the fact that you don't recognize this device, you assume it
		  isn't Fornish, and put it out of your mind.</p>
		  
		  <p>The small spiders seem restless, but aren't attacking yet. If you're careful, you might be able to shy them back from
		  the torch in order to milk the dead giant that rests in the centre of the room. You will need to be on your guard, 
		  however. These creatures cetainly caused the death of the men in the corner, and you've seen the fatal effect of their
		  poison firsthand, both on your King, and at the Whitelake infirmary.</p>
		  
		  <p>A thought causes you to pause a moment, and you reconsider the dead here. Surely they are a part of the same group 
		  that you tended to in the infirmary. These men, however, are armed. Perhaps your new patients aren't simple 
		  tradesmen after all...</em></p>
