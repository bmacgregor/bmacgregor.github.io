		  <p><em>Death, it seems, is your constant companion. You were as powerless to save the six men as you were to prevent the 
		  murder of your King. However, you reflect, all is not lost. You have learned a things, despite fate's unkind hand. First, you 
		  are certain of the source of the poison which took Traem's life, and you have a clue to the source. Simple chance didn't 
		  bring the soldiers in the spider's warren to their end, and you are sure that Adra's patients were among their number. 
		  Perhaps they gave the deadly toxins extracted from the butchered spider you saw in the nest to someone else, who in turn, 
		  brought it to Marris, and conspired to have it fall in with your poultices and medicines.</p>
		  
		  <p>Your next clue, it seems, is the coat of arms emblazoned on the soldier's shields and armour - a hawk on the wing, 
		  clutching a broken sword. If you can find the origin of the crest, it might point you in the direction of those truly 
		  responsible for bringing death to Traem. If you can link them with Baelin Drannis, you might be able to clear your name.</p>
		  
		  <p>It's a long shot, you muse, but it's also your only chance. You are still far too known in Marris to go there to do 
		  your research, but the city of High-hall has a large library. You might find more information there, amongst the 
		  stacks.</em></p>
