		  <p><em>Death, it seems, is your constant companion. You were as powerless to save the six men as you were to prevent the 
		  murder of your King. However, you reflect, all is not lost. You have learned a things, despite fate's unkind hand. First, you 
		  are certain of the source of the poison which took Traem's life, and you have a clue to the source. Simple chance didn't 
		  bring the soldiers in the spider's warren to their end, and you are sure that Adra's patients were among their number. 
		  Perhaps they gave the deadly toxins extracted from the butchered spider you saw in the nest to someone else, who in turn, 
			  brought it to Marris, and conspired to have it fall in with your poultices and medicines.</em></p>
