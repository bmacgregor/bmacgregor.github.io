		  <p><em>The stink of decay is heavy in the air as you step into the central chamber. In the corner are several 
		  human corpses, as well as two monstrous spiders. On closer inspection, one of the spiders appears to be dead, ichor 
		  covering the ground under its sword-like legs. The other, however, looks alive, but at rest.</p>
		  
		  <p>Looking closer at the dead men, you notice an odd device that most of them display, either on a shield or burnt 
		  into their leather armour. Due to your education, you're familiar with most of the noble families of Fornholm, 
		  but this insignia isn't one you're familiar with - a hawk on the wing clutching a broken sword. You notice 
		  relatively small wounds on the men - some bites, here and there, but nothing that would otherwise kill a healthy 
		  person...</p>
		  
		  <p>Your medically trained mind observes the bodies as you were taught, forgetting about the danger of the massive 
		  spider awakening. How would four soldiers die by simple bites when they don't display any other wounds? The torch 
		  gutters, and brings you back to reality...</em></p>
