		  <p><em>Old King Traem's sickness was no accident - you're sure of that now; the leagues between you and your disgraced 
		  family, brought low by your alleged crime have driven that into your head. You remember Master Baelin, your mentor, giving 
		  you the instructions to make a potion - one, you assumed, that would cure the ailing lord.</p>
		  <p>He was so careful, you reflect, not to be involved. His assurances that the credit of healing the withered old man 
		  would be solely yours, now revealed for what they were - a noose for a guiless fool. If only there was some way of studying 
		  the poison that you so innocently administered. Then, perhaps, you might begin to clear your name, and turn your
		  attention to another means.</p>
		  <p>The utter destruction Baelin Drannis; head Physiker, and murderer of the King.</p></em>
