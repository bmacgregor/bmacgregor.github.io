		  <p><em>Entering the clearing makes your skin crawl - this is a place of disease. In particular, the caves and what hides 
		  in their thick shadows quickens your warriors heart, but not to battle. Instead, you feel an overwhelming urge to flee 
		  - like prey.</p>
		  
		  <p>You shake your head and force your traitorous thougts to be still, breathing as you were taught and slowing your 
		  pulse. A shield of calm falls over you, armouring your mind against the fear that pervades the small clearing. You focus, 
		  and your third sight clears. In the snows and amongst the trees you count nine discarded sacks - pale and nearly 
		  translucent, burst open and forgotten, their contents scuttling, days or weeks ago into the shadows of the caves, and 
		  nestling beneath your feet.</p>
		  
		  <p>Your mind is recalled to your body, along with the knowledge you've uncovered. These are no natural caves.</p>
		  
		  <p>This place is a burrow.</em></p>
