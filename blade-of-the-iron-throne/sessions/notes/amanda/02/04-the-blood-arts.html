		  <p><em>It's worse than you feared - much worse. The things that now lay in ragged piles before you should not be, and their 
      existence is an affront to the gods themselves. They were the product of the blood arts - a thing so vile that it is 
      spoken of once in your people's for fear that the old gods might re-awaken and roam the world, as they did before the 
      Breaking.</p>
      
      <p>You peer deeper into the murk of the cave, and darkness yawns back. If there are more of these things beyond, you cannot 
      leave them alive. This place is now unsealed - if anything escapes, it could put worlds in jeopardy.</p>
      
      <p>Grimly, you heft your weapon, knowing that you must cleanse this place of the cancerous filth that have made it 
      their home.</em></p>
