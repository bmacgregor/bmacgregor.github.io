		  <p><em>These are the words of your people, but they are profane - the stuff of madness, that would unshackle the dead from 
      their bonds, and give birth to uncountable horrors, and these words are cut into the living stone - a wound in the world 
      itself.</p>
      
      <p>You turn to regard the dead thing behind you - once mortal, but now a disgusting parody of your people's beliefs, 
      steeped in the darkest of Kevanjic lore and theology.</p>
      
      <p>Looking closer, you notice a small brand on the thing's exposed forearm - a hooked cross held by a gloved fist. Your 
      preternatural senses pulse, and instinctively you step back from the corpse. With your third eye, you see a shadow peel 
      itself from the dead thing, and turn to regard you. It shrieks, unleashing a terrible laughter, and is gone in an 
      instant.</em></p>
