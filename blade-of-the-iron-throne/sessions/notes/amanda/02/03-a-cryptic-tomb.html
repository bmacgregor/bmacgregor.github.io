		  <p><em>As the drunk speaks, you discount a few things. First, your people do not participate in blood ritual - it is 
		  forbidden by the ancestors; spoken of once to younglings and then never again. To mention more than this is to call the dead 
		  gods back to the world. It is not done.</p>
		  
		  <p>You are about to reproach the besotted fool when he dips his hand into a mug and scrawls out a number of glyphs on 
		  the bar in front of you. He draws three, and their names are Ancient, Undying, and Breath.</p>
		  
		  <p>You feel your brows knit together. How does such a person know these things? Why would the tribes venture this far 
		  south? For these are indeed Kevanjic runes, and old ones at that. Perhaps this tomb bears investigation. You 
		  turn your attention back to the drunk.</em></p>
