		  <p><em>In your dream, you are home, in your small village on the eastern edge of Kevanja, hidden amongst the fjords. Your 
      people are as you remember them, before you were taken and sold. The nightfires blaze, as they always have - keeping the 
      dark - and the things that creep within its blackened cloak - at bay. This is a memory, you know, but it's a good one. This 
      was the night that your spirit mother held you up and made you Priestess of your small village.</p>
      
      <p>You remember drinking from the earthen pot holding herbs sacred to your people - Mountain's Tears, Brighting-leaf, and a 
      dozen other plants gathered to make a powerful elixer. This time, however, is different. You touch the earthen pot to your 
      lips, and instead of truth and euphoria, something in your mind shudders, worming through your conciousness with icy 
      tendrils.</p>
      
      <p>Your vision blurs, and the memory of your home is swept away in a torrent of freezing darkness. Half-seen shapes swim 
      amidst the figid waters of your dream, and you can feel the sliver in your mind, left by your attempt to contact the other 
      side of the artifacts found in Palisin's hut attempting to waken. All around, you hear an alien cacophony as the darkened 
      shapes swim closer to you, groping their way under the waters with scaled hands...</p>
      
      <p>You bolt awake, covered in sweat.</em></p>
