		  <p><em>The glyphs beyond the burial chamber swarm through your mind, enveloping your senses completely. You feel your 
      body fall to the stone floor, but your mind is far away, entrenched in the dark knowledge that the glyphs promise.</p>
      
      <p>An image of your maker spews forth from a cataclysm of shadow, and with him, Alistra, sole heir to the throne. She 
      comes to you, her eyes hungry and knowing, stepping lightly through the murk, her gown alive in the wind that whips you 
      both, and threatens to cut the flesh from your bones. You take her, as you were taken many decades ago, your teeth out. 
      It's as if you are suddenly awake.</p>
      
      <p>Alive.</p>
      
      <p>Your body twitches, and your consciousness returns to its mortal shackles, but full of a horrible knowing - of how 
      to turn a mortal into someone - some thing - like you.</p>
      
      <p>A single word hangs in your mind - a haunting message, Alistra's last whisper before you were drawn away. A clue, 
      perhaps.</p>
