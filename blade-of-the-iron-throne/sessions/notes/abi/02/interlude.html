		  <p><em>Sleep, when it comes, is brief as ever, and you awaken to Hedeg, the old blind man mumbling incoherently. He talks 
      in a rhythm that reminds you of a heartbeat - measured and slow. Although you're sure that he's said far more, you catch 
      only a small bit of what he's saying:</em></p>
      
      <div class="container text-justify">
          <p>Burnéd, blighted, begone to ash and smoke - <br/>
          Cinder charred, the ancient nightmare awoke.<br/>
          Naivunnan lost - to 'ere that broken realm - <br/>
          Asunder cleft, where darkest revels dwell.</p>
          <br/>
          Returnéd they when broken is the heir - <br/>
          To claim what folly lost beyond repair.<br/>
          Awaiting in the stars the lords are coiled - <br/>
          Naivunnan's rise, where all will be despoil't</p>
      </div>
      
      <p><em>The old fool trails off, his voice turning to a whisper, but his strange rhyme echoes in your mind - its meaning 
      escapes you, but you are sure sure words cannot be good.</em></p>
