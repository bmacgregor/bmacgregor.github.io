		  <p><em>The last of the wraiths fall, your sword shuddering as it impacts a spinal column. The fool, it seems, has led you 
      to the exact place you have been seeking; this appears to be a coven-house.</p>
      
      <p>Well, not a coven-house exactly. These sorry wretches were trapped here by some design, but this is a place that 
      reminds you of your home, burrowed underground and warm. It seems like such a waste for the livestock to have gone insane - 
      normally, thralls such as the dozen dead that lie in heaps at your feet are docile - living to serve, and be fed upon.
      Perhaps, you reflect, their time imprisoned here snapped their tiny minds, and caused them to go feral.</p>
      
      <p>One thing you are certain of, however, is the presence of another, like you. Somewhere deep inside this tomb lurks 
      a creature of great power and age; though if its thralls had lost their minds, how much worse might their master 
      be?</em></p>
