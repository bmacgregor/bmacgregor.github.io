		  <p><em>Awakening to find your coven destroyed remains a harsh memory, and the evidence that your kith and kin were slain by the 
		  Gray Church has left your embittered heart a broken, savage thing. Although your drive for revenge is what keeps you moving 
		  forward, a thought tugs at you. You weren't always like this; fearing the day, otherworldly, a creature of dark - once, you 
		  remember, you were healthy. Human. This affliction - what you call your vampirism - is a thing that was </em>done<em> to you.</p>
		  <p>Perhaps you could learn its ways. Embrace the power it offers. You don't yet know how to create more like you,
		  but before your family was destroyed there were whispers of how more of your kind might be made. Lifedrain, they called it.<p>
		  <p>The art of creation.</em></p>
