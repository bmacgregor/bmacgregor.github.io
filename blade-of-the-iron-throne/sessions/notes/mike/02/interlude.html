		  <p><em>You awaken from a pleasantly dreamless sleep, the wench you bedded down with long gone and your room empty. Sounds of 
      patrons moving about float up from the </em>Rose and Barrel's <em>common room - chairs scraping against the wooden floor, 
      and the muted din of conversation marking the inn open for business and breakfast.</p>
      
      <p>Hungry, you dress and head downstairs, greeted by the smell of fresh bread and bacon, and a room full of people - a stark 
      contrast to the small number present when you arrived last night. Something in how they move - how they've placed 
      themselves around the room nags at you. They seem alert, despite their travel-stained clothes. Here and there, you note 
      steel concealed beneath heavy cloaks, and the telltale creak of leather as they move.</p>
      
      <p>Soldiers, it seems, have come to Whitelake. Any sign of heraldry is conspicuously absent, but your time in the military
      marks them for what they are. You make a quick count - there are almost twenty of them here, but it's possible that more are 
      elsewhere in the town, or are somewhere out of sight in the forest.</p>
      
      <p>You nod a greeting to Ranek, the inn's proprietor as he passes you a bit of bread and some meat.</em> "Best mind 
      yourself," <em>he says, motioning toward the front doors of the inn. Taking his advice, you leave quietly to meet your 
      companions at Palisin's hut.</em></p>
