		  <p><em>The merchants jabber on, clearly talking to fill the sudden gap in your end of the conversation. This does not 
		  bode well - men deserting is one thing, a fact of war and armies, but enough leaving to plague the countryside, banding 
		  together in groups to prey on unfortunate fools like these two and blackening Ranulf's already battered name is a real 
		  problem.</p>
		  
		  <p>Your thoughts wend their way towards your dead. Your friends and comrades - Tessins, Hodrik, and the others. They'd 
		  not want your commanders' name tarnished, as these men are doing, leaving Ranulf's name in tatters...<p>
		  
		  <p></em>'He's already a bastard and in the wrong country',<em> you tell yourself, idly thieving one of the merchant's 
		  purses from him. The ghosts of your past look on passively.</p>
		  
		  <p></em>'There's nothing I can do,'<em> you reason with them. Hod scratches his chin. Tessins gives a half-hearted 
		  shrug. You've been seeing your dead more, recently. Not enough distractions, you think.</p>
		  
		  <p>Maybe dealing with these bandits will be distraction enough.</em></p>
