		  <p><em>After glancing at your stolen map, you note that you're close to the Eldrani border, and to the Bastard's 
		  War by proxy. It's unlikely that Ranfulf knows of his father's death, or the mud that the Council of Lords has been 
		  slinging to blacken his name. If you're going to help your old commander win his crown, you'll have to make 
		  sure that he knows what's going on in his country.</p>
		  <p>Whitelake, a small fishing village, is nearby - if you and your group push hard, you might be able to make it there by
		  daybreak. With any luck, they'll have a courier that could get word to Ranulf, and perhaps you might be able to 
		  stem the tide of rumors that threaten his reputation and his inheritance.</em></p>
