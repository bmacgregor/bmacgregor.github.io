# Blade SRD

The rules (pretty much) as written, with some notable edits.  These include a real effort to include both gender pro-nouns 
throughout the rules, fixing spelling and grammar mistakes (as well as adding my own), and trying to clean up the rules by 
adding some addendum-type stuff.  Blade's a crunchy system, which is awesome, but at times can be difficult to understand.

The choice to mess with the pronouns stems from how the game's presented.  Yes, it's Sword & Sorcery, but the actual rule-book 
features naked women on *every single page* which is both grating and awkward, especially if you're trying to read the book 
in public.  I'd like to avoid looking like an absolute creepshow, and casually flipping through NSFW content on the bus, at work 
or wherever feels very cringe to me.  Arguing that "it's part of the genre" is all well and good until you have to explain to 
someone that "nonono, you're not a weird asshole - the game's actually really cool."  Plus, the crowd I game with is pretty 
evenly split along gender lines, and because of this, the rules as presented are a tough sell.

Hence, this SRD, the lack of nudie pics throughout it, and a heavy-handed editting of the pronouns.  Having "sweet lookin 
chicks" pasted all over your rulebook is one thing, and explaining it away as "just how S&S is" to back that up is dubious at 
best, but then having a total lack of a female presence throughout feels skeezy to me.  If you hate this change, feel free to 
buy a copy of the rules for yourself where you don't have to deal with my semi-social justice warrior hangups and get all of the 
naked ladies you could possibly want.  It just doesn't sit well with my group and me.
